In addition, the extraoral area on the left neck was prepped with Betadine and draped accordingly.  Gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in the left lower quadrant, total of 3.4 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine and Marcaine 1.7 mL of 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  An incision was made with #15 blade in the left submandibular area through the skin and blunt dissection was accomplished with curved mosquito hemostat to the inferior border of the mandible.  No purulent drainage was obtained.  The 0.25 inch Penrose drain was then placed in the extraoral incision and it was secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Moving to the intraoral area, periosteal elevator was used to elevate the periosteum from the buccal aspect of tooth #19.  The area did not drain any purulent material.  The carious tooth #19 was then extracted by elevator and forceps extraction.  After the tooth was removed, the 0.25 inch Penrose drain was placed in a subperiosteal fashion adjacent to the extraction site and secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The tube was then repositioned to the left side allowing access to the upper right quadrant where tooth #2 was then extracted by routine elevator and forceps extraction.  After the extraction, the throat pack was removed.  An orogastric tube was then placed by Dr. X, and stomach contents were suctioned.  The pharynx was then suctioned with the Yankauer suction.

The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.,A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component.,At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially.,A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert.,This gave good stability and a full range of motion.,The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for.,A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly.,The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation.,Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples. A sterile, bulky compression dressing was placed. The patient was stable on operative release.",Orthopedic

There is a twin gestation in the vertex transverse lie with an anterior placenta and a normal amount of amniotic fluid surrounding both of the twins.  The fetal biometry of twin A is as follows.  The biparietal diameter is 4.9 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, head circumference 17.6 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 1 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, and femur length is 3.1 cm consistent with 19 weeks and 5 days, and the humeral length is 3.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day.  The average gestational age by ultrasound is 20 weeks and 1 day and the estimated fetal weight is 353 g.  The following structures are seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey, the shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels and the placenta.,Limited in views of baby A with a nasolabial region.,The following is the fetal biometry for twin B. The biparietal diameter is 4.7 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, head circumference 17.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, the femur length is 3.3 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 3 days, and the humeral length is 3.1 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, the average gestational age by ultrasound is 22 weeks and 2 days, and the estimated fetal weight is 384 g.  The following structures were seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey.  The shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels, and the placenta.  Limited on today's ultrasound the views of nasolabial region.,In summary, this is a twin gestation, which may well be monochorionic at 20 weeks and 1 day.  There is like gender and a single placenta.  One cannot determine with certainty whether or not this is a monochorionic or dichorionic gestation from the ultrasound today.,I sat with the patient and her husband and discussed alternative findings and the complications.  We focused our discussion today on the association of twin pregnancy with preterm delivery.  We discussed the fact that the average single intrauterine pregnancy delivers at 40 weeks' gestation while the average twin delivery occurs at 35 weeks' gestation.  We discussed the fact that 15% of twins deliver prior to 32 weeks' gestation.  These are the twins which we have the most concern regarding the long-term prospects of prematurity.  We discussed several etiologies of preterm delivery including preterm labor, incompetent cervix, premature rupture of the fetal membranes as well as early delivery from preeclampsia and growth restriction.  We discussed the use of serial transvaginal ultrasound to assess for early cervical change and the use of serial transabdominal ultrasound to assess for normal interval growth.  We discussed the need for frequent office visits to screen for preeclampsia.  We also discussed treatment options such as cervical cerclage, bedrest, tocolytic medications, and antenatal steroids.  I would recommend that the patient return in two weeks for further cervical assessment and assessment of fetal growth and well-being.,In closing, I do want to thank you very much for involving me in the care of your delightful patient.  I did review all of the above findings and recommendations with the patient today at the time of her visit.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I could be of any further help to you.,Total visit time 40 minutes.",Radiology

2301,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bunion, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bunion, right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Austin/akin bunionectomy, right foot.,HISTORY: , This 77-year-old African-American female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states she has had a bunion deformity for as long as she can remember that has progressively become worse and more painful.  The patient has attempted conservative treatment without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  An IV was instituted by Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety strap across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed around the right ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo block type fashion.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated to the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating field and the stockinet was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was directed to the bunion deformity on the right foot.  An approximately 6 cm dorsal medial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated with hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue were then undermined off of the capsule medially.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The periosteum and capsule were then reflected off of the first metatarsal.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  The articular cartilage was healthy for patient's age and race.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed..  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was carried out until the adductor tendon insertions were identified.  The adductor tendons were transected as well as a lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor hallucis longus to make sure that tendon that was transected was the extensor hallucis brevis at the _______ digitorum.  Extensor hallucis brevis tendon was transected and care was taken to preserve the extensor halucis longus tendon.  Attention was then directed to medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Sagittal was then used to create a long dorsal arm outside the Austin type osteotomy and the first metatarsal.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally until correction of the intermetatarsal angle was noted.  The head was intact.  A 0.45 K-wire was inserted through subcutaneously from proximal medial to distal lateral.  A second K-wire was then inserted from distal lateral to proximal plantar medial.  Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site.  The K-wires were bent, cut, and pin caps were placed.  Attention was then directed to the proximal phalanx of the hallux.  The capsular periostem was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal was then used to create an akin osteotomy closing wedge.  The apex was lateral and the base of the wedge was medial.  The wedge was removed in the total and the osteotomy site was then feathered until closure was achieved without compression.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted, one from distal medial to proximal lateral and the second from distal lateral to proximal medial across the osteotomy site.  Adequate fixation was noted at the osteotomy site and the osteotomy was closed.  The toe was noted to be in a markedly more rectus position.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining prominent medial eminence.  The area was then smoothed with a reciprocating rasp.  There was noted to be a small osteophytic formation laterally over first metatarsal head that was removed with a rongeur and smoothed with a reciprocating rasp.  The area was then inspected for any remaining short bony edges, none were noted.,Copious amounts of sterile saline was then used to flush the surgical site.  The capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular #5-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips were applied and 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the surgical site.,Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, copious Betadine, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.  A _______ cast was then applied postoperatively.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported from the operating room to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Tylenol #3 and instructed to take one q4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. for pain.

She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.

He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery.  The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits.  The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was constructed.  Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system.  The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford.  Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered.  Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices.  These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home.,Treatment plan was then performed by me.  I outlined the tumor volume.  Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient.  This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator.  The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy.  The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm.  The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%.  The coverage isodose line was 79%.  The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55.  The treatment plan was reviewed by me and Dr. Y of Radiation Oncology, and the treatment plan was approved.,On the morning of May 14, 2004, the patient arrived at the Outpatient CyberKnife Suite.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was applied.  Initial imaging was used to bring the patient into optimal position.  The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver the 20 Gy to the AVM margin.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was given 8 mg of Decadron for prophylaxis and discharged home.,Followup will consist of an MRI scan in 6 months.  The patient will return to our clinic once that study is completed.,I was present and participated in the entire procedure on this patient consisting of CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital AVM.,Dr. X was present during the entire procedure and will be dictating his own operative note.",Surgery
4615,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Hip pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.

3024,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,OPERATION:,  Cysto stent removal.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local MAC.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient was on vancomycin and Levaquin was given x1 dose.  The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis.  CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.

Peyronie's disease.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Ex-plantation of inflatable penile prosthesis and then placement of second inflatable penile prosthesis AMS700.,ANESTHESIA:,  General LMA.,SPECIMEN: , Old triple component inflatable penile prosthesis.,PROCEDURE:  ,This is a 64-year-old male with prior history of Peyronie's disease and prior placement of a triple component inflatable penile prosthesis, which had worked for years for him, but has stopped working and subsequently has opted for ex-plantation and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed consent, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra.  The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter.  At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space.  Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture.  At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies.  Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant.  This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis.  At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis.  As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery.  At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum.  This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body.  The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty.  However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures.  This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body.  The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted.  After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen.  Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators.  These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces.  At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.  He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed.  We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis.  Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest.  We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm.  At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty.  Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders.  This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis.  There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea.  The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion.  ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants.  At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times.  There was a very good fit and we had a very good result.  At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump.  Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty.  The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated.  After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result.  At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic.  The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers.  The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples.  Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours.  This was also sutured in place with nylon.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally.  Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine.  No Foley catheter was used or placed.,The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr. McDevitt.  Cardiology will be asked to consult with Dr. Stomel for a pacer placement and he will be placed on the Telemetry floor and kept on IV antibiotics.",Surgery

Bunionectomy, SCARF type, with metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, left.,2.  Arthroplasty left second toe.,HISTORY:  ,This 39-year-old female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has had bunion for many months.  It has been progressively getting more painful at this time.  The patient attempted conservative treatment including wider shoe gear without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinette was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule.  Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle.  Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created.  The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected.  A lateral capsulotomy was performed.  Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence.  The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy.  A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle.  After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire.  A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted.  The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw.  Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges.  The temporary fixation wires were then removed.  The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted.  Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed.  A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule.  The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially.  Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress type fashion.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  A dorsal linear incision was then created over the proximal phalangeal joint of the left second toe.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade and the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the capsule to be aligned laterally.  An incision was made on either side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  A curved mosquito stat was then used to reflex the tendon laterally.  The joint was identified and the medial collateral ligamentous attachments were resected off the head of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the head of the proximal head.  The bone was then rolled and the lateral collateral attachments were transected and the bone was removed in toto.  The extensor digitorum longus tendon was inspected and noted to be intact.  Any sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  Pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and an immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.

General LMA anesthesia was administered.  She is prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  She was placed in the Trendelenburg position and the left subclavian vein was cannulated and a guide wire placed through the wire.  Fluoroscopy was used to confirm appropriate guide wire location in the subclavian vein to the superior vena cava.  The incision was then made around the guide wire, taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electric Bovie cautery.  A pocket was made in the subcutaneous tissue of adequate size for the port which was cut at 16 cm for appropriate locationing which was cut at 16 cm based on superficial measurements.  The 2-0 Vicryl sutures were used to secure the port in place and the sheath introducer was placed over the guide wire and the guide wire removed with a Port catheter being placed into the sheath introducer.  Fluoroscopy was used to confirm appropriate positioning of the catheter and the skin was closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl followed by running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.

She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  TED hose and SCDs were placed.  After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin.  These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.,After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin.  They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement.  Undermining was performed.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene.  Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made.  Dissection was carried down to the capsule.  It was extremely calcified.  Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed.

4125,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:,  Strokes.,SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY DIAGNOSIS:  ,Global aphasia.,SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient is a 44-year-old female who is referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy, status post stroke.  The patient's sister-in-law was present throughout this assessment and provided all the patient's previous medical history.  Based on the sister-in-law's report, the patient had a stroke on 09/19/08.  The patient spent 6 weeks at XY Medical Center, where she was subsequently transferred to XYZ for therapy for approximately 3 weeks.  ABCD brought the patient to home the Monday before Thanksgiving, because they were not satisfied with the care the patient was receiving at a skilled nursing facility in Tucson.  The patient's previous medical history includes a long history of illegal drug use to include cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and marijuana.  In March of 2008, the patient had some type of potassium issue and she was hospitalized at that time.  Prior to the stroke, the patient was not working and ABCD reported that she believes the patient completed the ninth grade, but she did not graduate from high school.  During the case history, I did pose several questions to the patient, but her response was often ""no.""  She was very emotional during this evaluation and crying occurred multiple times.,OBJECTIVE:  ,To evaluate the patient's overall communication ability, a Western Aphasia Battery was completed.  Also tests were not done due to time constraint and the patient's severe difficulty and emotional state.  Speech automatic tests were also completed to determine if the patient had any functional speech.,ASSESSMENT:,  Based on the results of the Weston aphasia battery, the patient's deficits most closely resemble global aphasia.  On the spontaneous speech subtest, the patient responded ""no"" to all questions asked except for how are you today where she gave a thumbs-up.  She provided no responses to picture description task and it is unclear if the patient was unable to follow the direction or if she was unable to see the picture clearly.  The patient's sister-in-law did state that the patient wore glasses, but she currently does not have them and she did not know the extent the patient's visual deficit.,On the auditory verbal comprehension portion of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient answered ""no"" to all ""yes/no"" questions.  The auditory word recognition subtest, the patient had 5 out of 60 responses correct.  With the sequential command, she had 10 out of 80 corrects.  She was able to shut her eyes, point to the window, and point to the pen after directions.  With repetition subtest, she repeated bed correctly, but no other stimuli.  At this time, the patient became very emotional and repeatedly stated ""I can't"".  During the naming subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, the patient's responses contained numerous paraphasias and her speech was often unintelligible due to jargon.  The word fluency test was not administered and the patient scored 2 out of 10 on the sentence completion task and 0 out of 10 on the responsive speech.  In regards to speech automatics, the patient is able to count from 1 to 9 accurately; however, stated 7 instead of 10 at the end of the task.  She is not able to state the days of the week or months in the year or her name at this time.  She cannot identify the day on calendar and was unable to verbally state the date or month.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient's communication deficits most closely resemble global aphasia where she has difficulty with both receptive as well as expressive communication.  She does perseverate and is very emotional due to probable frustration.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended to improve the patient's functional communication skills.,PATIENT GOAL: , Her sister-in-law stated that they would like to improve upon the patient's speech to allow her to communicate more easily at home.,PLAN OF CARE: , Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week for the next 12 weeks.  Therapy to include aphasia treatment and home activities.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):,1.  The patient will answer simple ""yes/no"" questions with greater than 90% accuracy with minimal cueing.,2.  The patient will be able to complete speech automatic tasks with greater than 80% accuracy without models or cueing.,3.  The patient will be able to complete simple sentence completion and/or phrase completion with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,4.  The patient will be able to follow simple one-step commands with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,5.  The patient will be able to name 10 basic everyday objects with greater than 80% accuracy with minimal cueing.,SHORT-TERM GOALS (12 WEEKS):,  Functional communication abilities to allow the patient to express her basic wants and needs.",Consult - History and Phy.
513,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Rejection of renal transplant.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Rejection of renal transplant.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Transplant nephrectomy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient has had rapid deterioration of her kidney function since her transplant at ABCD one year ago.  The patient was recently thought to have obstruction to the transplant and a stent was placed in to the transplant percutaneously, but the ureter was wide open and there was no evidence of obstruction.  Because the kidney was felt to be irretrievably lost and immunosuppression had been withdrawn, it was elected to go ahead and remove the kidney and hopes that her fever and toxic course could be arrested.,With the patient in the supine position, the previously placed nephrostomy tube was removed.  The patient then after adequate prepping and draping, and placing of a small roll under the right hip, underwent an incision in the direction of the transplant incision down through and through all muscle layers and into the preperitoneal space.  The kidney was encountered and kidney was dissected free of its attachments through the retroperitoneal space.  During the course of dissection, the iliac artery and vein were identified as was the native ureter and the patient's ilioinguinal nerve; all these were preserved.  The individual vessels in the kidney were identified, ligated, and incised, and the kidney was removed.  The ureter was encountered during the course of resection, but was not ligated.  The patient's retroperitoneal space was irrigated with antibiotic solution and #19 Blake drain was placed into the retroperitoneal space, and the patient returned to the recovery room in good condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  900 mL.",Surgery

He was anesthetized with a combination of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine with Epinephrine on both upper eyelids.  The area of obvious scar tissue from the radiation for the squamous cell carcinoma on the right upper eyelid was completely excised down to the eyelid margin including resection of a few of the upper eye lashes.  This was extended essentially from the punctum to the lateral commissure and extended up on to the upper eyelid.  The resection was carried down through the orbicularis muscle resecting the pretarsal orbicularis muscle and the inferior portion of the preseptal orbicularis muscle leaving the tarsus intact and leaving the orbital septum intact.  Following complete resection, the patient was easily able to open and close his eyes as the levator muscle insertion was left intact to the tarsal plate.  The specimen was sent to pathology, which revealed only fibrotic tissue and no evidence of any residual squamous cell carcinoma.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with Bovie cautery and a full-thickness skin graft was taken from the opposite upper eyelid in a fashion similar to a blepharoplasty of the appropriate size for the defect in the right upper eyelid.  The left upper eyelid incision was closed with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures, and the skin graft was sutured in place with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures.  An eye patch was placed on the right side, and the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to PACU in good condition.",Surgery

She did complain of some dyspareunia and wants a definitive diagnosis.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus is small and anteverted with mildly decreased mobility on the left side.  There are no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus is normal appearing but slightly compressible.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appear normal.  There is evidence of endometriosis on the left pelvic sidewall in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was no endometriosis in the right pelvic sidewall or along the bladder flap.,There were some adhesions on the right abdominal sidewall from the previous appendectomy.  The liver margin, gallbladder, and bowel appeared normal.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A sharp curettage was performed until a gritty texture was noted in all aspects of the endometrium.  The moderate amount of tissue that was obtained was sent to Pathology.  The #20 Hank dilator was then replaced and the sterile speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  The Veress needle was placed into this incision and the gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  The #11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and a camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A Bierman needle was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline to allow a better visualization of the pelvic organs.  A 5 mm port was placed approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the right of the umbilicus and approximately 3 cm inferior.  The harmonic scalpel was placed through this port and the areas of endometriosis were ablated using the harmonic scalpel.  A syringe was placed on to the Bierman needle and a small amount of fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac was removed to allow better visualization of the posterior cul-de-sac.  The lesions in the posterior cul-de-sac were then ablated using the Harmonic scalpel.  All instruments were then removed.  The Bierman needle and 5 mm port was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.  The skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  ,Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was placed in the incision sites.  The dilator and vulsellum tenaculum were removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Preoperative imaging studies revealed the above-noted abnormalities. After a detailed review of management considerations with the patient and his wife, he was elected to proceed as noted above.,Operative indications, methods, potential benefits, risks and alternatives were reviewed. The patient and his wife expressed understanding and consented to proceed as above.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk protrusion with configuration as anticipated from preoperative imaging studies. Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was ""under tapped"" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline. The superficial paraspinal musculature in posterior fashion was closed in the midline using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures.

1227,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left leg claudication.,POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: ,  Left leg claudication.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off.,ANESTHESIA: , Conscious sedation.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient presents with lower extremity claudication.  She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence.  She appears to understand and agrees to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position.  After adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with Chloraseptic prep.  Cloth towels and paper drapes were placed.  Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a ,4-French sheath.  Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed.  The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire.  This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath.  This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.,The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  A glidewire was carefully advanced using Roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.,Final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  A search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  Post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  Further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  For this reason, I chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.,I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  Attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  Access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath.  This was immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire was exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  The destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  Initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  No further significant abnormality was identified.  To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to.  I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.,FINDINGS: , Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  There is a single left renal artery.  The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal.  On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally.  At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted.  Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted.  The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf.  The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.,On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent.  Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery.  This was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement.  The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice.,IMPRESSION,1.  Normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery.,2.  Normal infrarenal aorta as well as normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries.,3.  The proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries.  Successful angioplasty with reasonable results in the distal superficial femoral, popliteal and proximal posterior tibial artery as described.,4.  Normal proximal left superficial femoral artery with functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery successfully treated with angioplasty and stent placement.  Run-off to the left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery.",Surgery

Streptococcal pneumonia with sepsis.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Unobtainable as the patient is intubated for respiratory failure.,CURRENT HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 20-year-old female who presented with symptoms of pneumonia and developed rapid sepsis and respiratory failure requiring intubation.  At this time, she is being treated aggressively with mechanical ventilation and other supportive measures and has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation with prolonged partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer.  At this time, I am being consulted for further evaluation and recommendations for treatment.  The nurses report that she has actually improved clinically over the last 24 hours.  Bleeding has been a problem; however, it seems to have been abrogated at this time with factor replacement as well as platelet infusion.  There is no prior history of coagulopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Otherwise nondescript as is the past surgical history.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,There were possible illicit drugs.  Her family is present, and I have discussed her case with her mother and sister.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Otherwise noncontributory.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Not otherwise pertinent.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  She is a sedated, young black female in no acute distress, lying in bed intubated.,VITAL SIGNS:  She has a rate of 67, blood pressure of 100/60, and the respiratory rate per the ventilator approximately 14 to 16.,HEENT:  Her sclerae showed conjunctival hemorrhage.

Oropharynx has ET tube in place.,NECK:  No jugular venous pressure distention.,CHEST:  Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with good bowel sounds.  There was some oozing around the site of her central line.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  There is no evidence of compromise arterial blood flow at the digits or of her hands or feet.,LABORATORY STUDIES:  ,The DIC parameters with a platelet count of approximately 50,000, INR of 2.4, normal PTT at this time, fibrinogen of 200, and a D-dimer of 13.,IMPRESSION/PLAN:  ,At this time is disseminated intravascular coagulation from sepsis from pneumococcal disease.  My recommendation for the patient is to continue factor replacement as you are.  It seems that her clinical course is reversing and simple factor replacement is probably is the best measure at this time.  There is no indication at this point for Xigris.  However, if her coagulopathy does not resolve within the next 24 hours and continue to improve with an elevated fibrinogen, normalization of her coagulation times, I would consider low-dose continuous infusion heparin for abrogation of consumption of coagulation routines and continued supportive infusions.  I will repeat her laboratory studies in the morning and give more recommendations at that time.",Hematology - Oncology

The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",Neurosurgery

Basically the patient states that yesterday she fell and she is not certain about the circumstances, on her driveway, and on her left side hit a rock.  When she came to the emergency room, she was found to have a rapid atrial tachyarrhythmia, and was put on Cardizem with reportedly heart rate in the 50s, so that was stopped.  Review of EKGs from that time shows what appears to be multifocal atrial tachycardia with followup EKG showing wandering atrial pacemaker.  An ECG this morning showing normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.  Her potassium at that time was 3.1.

On general exam, she is a pleasant elderly woman who is hard of hearing, but is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Shows cranium is  normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has moist mucosal membranes.  Neck veins were not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation anteriorly without wheezes.  She is relatively immobile because of her left hip fracture.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2, regular rate, frequent ectopic beats, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, preserved aortic component of the second heart sound.  There is also a soft holosystolic murmur heard.  There is no rub or gallop.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities without significant clubbing, cyanosis, and there is trivial to 1+ peripheral edema.  Pulses appear grossly intact.  Affect is appropriate.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  She is not able to move because of left hip fracture easily in bed.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA: , Pertinent labs include chest x-ray with radiology report pending but shows only a calcified aortic knob.  No clear pulmonary vascular congestion.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7, it was 3.1 on admission, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 150, magnesium was 2 on 07/13/06.  Troponin was 0.03 followed by 0.18.  INR is 0.93, white blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 36, platelet count 115,000.,EKGs are reviewed.  Initial EKG done on 08/19/08 at 1832 shows MAT, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, no ischemic changes.  She had a followup EKG done at 20:37 on 08/19/08, which shows wandering atrial pacemaker and some lateral T-wave changes, not significantly changed from prior.  Followup EKG done this morning shows normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs.,IMPRESSION:  ,She is an 84-year-old female with a history of hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation with mild pulmonary hypertension and mild aortic stenosis admitted after a fall with left hip fracture and she will require surgery.  Telemetry now reviewed, shows predominantly normal sinus rhythm with frequent APCs _____ earlier yesterday evening showed burst of multifocal atrial tachycardia and I suspect that was exacerbated by prior hypokalemia, which has been corrected.  There has been no atrial fibrillation documented.  I do not feel these troponins are significant given the stress or fall in prior multifocal atrial tachycardia with increased rate especially in the absence of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She actually describes feeling good exercise capacity prior to this fall.  Given favorable risk to benefit ratio for needed left hip surgery, I feel she may proceed with needed left hip surgery from a cardiac standpoint with continued verapamil, which has been started, which should help control the multifocal atrial tachycardia, which she had and would watch for heart rate with that.  Continued optimization of electrolytes.  The patient cannot take beta-blockers as previously Toprol reportedly caused shortness of breath, although, there was some report that it caused bradycardia so we would watch her heart rate on the verapamil.  The patient is aware of the cardiac risks, certainly it is moderate, and wishes to proceed with needed surgery.  I do not feel any further cardiac evaluation is needed at this time and the patient may followup with Dr. X after discharge.  Regarding her mild thrombocytopenia, I would defer that to hospitalist and continue proton pump inhibitors for history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, management of left hip fracture as per orthopedist.",Emergency Room Reports

The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A longitudinal incision was made in line with the fourth ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease.  The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis.  The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially for 2-3 mm, and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf.,The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat.  The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat.  The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with a scissor.,After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl.  Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture.  A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed.

The patient was felt to be a candidate for decompression stabilization pulling distraction between the screws to relieve radicular pain.  The patient understood major risks and complications such as death and paralysis seemingly rare, main concern is a 10 to 15% of failure rate to respond to surgery for which further surgery may or may not be indicated, small risk of wound infection, spinal fluid leak.  The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was intubated.  Foley catheter was in place.  The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped.  A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel.  The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala.  Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone.  The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting.  The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints.  Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed.  Pars interarticularis were maintained.  Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise.  Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side.  Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe.  It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body.  At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed.  Good bone purchase was obtained.  Gelfoam was placed over the roots laterally, corticated transverse processes lateral facet joints were prepared, small infuse sponge was placed posterolaterally on the right side, then the local bone graft from L4 to S1.  Traction was applied between the L4-L5, L5-S1 screws locking notes were tightened out, heads were rotated fractured off about 2-3 mm traction were applied at each side, further opening the foramen for the exiting roots.  Prior to placement of BMP, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic irrigation.  Medium Hemovac drain was placed in the depth of wound, brought out through a separate stab incision.  Deep fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous fascia with #1 Vicryl, and subcuticular with 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was stapled.  The drain was sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl and connected to closed drain system.  The patient was laid supine on the bed, extubated, and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.

4076,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Breast reconstruction post mastectomy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 51-year-old lady, who had gone many years without a mammogram when she discovered a lump in her right breast early in February of this year.  She brought this to the attention of her primary care doctor and she soon underwent ultrasound and mammogram followed by needle biopsy, which revealed that there was breast cancer.  This apparently was positive in two separate locations within the suspicious area.  She also underwent MRI, which suggested that there was significant size to the area involved.  Her contralateral left breast appeared to be uninvolved.  She has had consultation with Dr. ABC and they are currently in place to perform a right mastectomy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Positive for hypertension, which is controlled on medications.  She is a nonsmoker and engages in alcohol only moderately.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Surgical history includes uterine fibroids, some kind of cyst excision on her foot, and cataract surgery.,ALLERGIES: , None known.,MEDICATIONS: , Lipitor, ramipril, Lasix, and potassium.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, the patient is a healthy looking 51-year-old lady, who is moderately overweight.  Breast exam reveals significant breast hypertrophy bilaterally with a double D breast size and significant shoulder grooving from her bra straps.  There are no any significant scars on the right breast as she has only undergone needle biopsy at this point.  Exam also reveals abdomen where there is moderate excessive fat, but what I consider a good morphology for a potential TRAM flap.,IMPRESSION:,  A 51-year-old lady for mastectomy on the right side, who is interested in the possibility of breast reconstruction.  We discussed the breast reconstruction options in some detail including immediate versus delayed reconstruction and autologous tissue versus implant reconstruction.  I think for a lady of this physical size and breast morphology that the likelihood of getting a good result with a tissue expander reconstruction is rather slim.  A further complicating factor is the fact that she may well be undergoing radiation after her mastectomy.  I would think this would make a simple tissue expander reconstruction virtually beyond the balance of consideration.  I have occasionally gotten away with tissue expanders with reasonable results in irradiated patients when they are thinner and smaller breasted, but in a heavier lady with large breasts, I think it virtually deemed to failure.  We therefore, mostly confine our discussion to the relative merits of TRAM flap breast reconstruction and latissimus dorsi reconstruction with implant.  In either case, the contralateral breast reduction would be part of the overall plan., ,The patient understands that the TRAM flap although not much more lengthy of a procedure is a little comfortable recovery.  Since we are sacrificing a rectus abdominus muscle that can be more discomfort and difficulties in healing both due to it being a respiratory muscle and to its importance in sitting up and getting out of bed.  In any case, she does prefer this option in order to avoid the need for an implant.  We discussed pros and cons of the surgery, including the risks such as infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen.  We also discussed some of the potential flap complications including partial or complete necrosis of the TRAM flap itself.,PLAN: , The patient is definitely interested in undergoing TRAM flap reconstruction.  At the moment, we are planning to do it as an immediate reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy.  For this reason, I have made arrangements to do initial vascular delay procedure within the next couple of days.  We may cancel this if the chance of postoperative irradiation is high.  If this is the case, I think we can do a better job on the reconstruction if we defer it.  The patient understands this and will proceed according to the recommendations from Dr. ABC and from the oncologist.",Cosmetic / Plastic Surgery

4453,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 54-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for weight reduction secondary to diabetes.  She did attend diabetes education classes at Abc Clinic.  She comes however, wanting to really work at weight reduction.  She indicates that she has been on the Atkins' diet for about two years and lost about ten pounds.  She is now following a veggie diet which she learned about in Poland originally.  She has been on it for three weeks and intends to follow it for another three weeks.  This does not allow any fruits or grains or starchy vegetables or meats.  She does eat nuts for protein.  She is wanting to know if she is at risk of having a severe low blood sugar reaction in this form of diet.  She also wants to know that if she gets skinny enough, if the diabetes will go away.  Her problem time, blood sugar wise, is in the morning.  She states that if she eats too much in the evening that her blood sugars are always higher the next morning.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight:  189 pounds.  Reported height:  5 feet 5 inches.  BMI is approximately 31-1/2.  Diabetes medications include metformin 500 mg daily.  Lab from 5/12/04:  Hemoglobin A1C was 6.4%.,A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for weight reduction.  A 1200-calorie meal plan was recommended.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's diet history reflects that she is highly restricting carbohydrates in her food intake.  She does not have blood sugar records with her for me to review, but we discussed strategies for improving blood sugar control in the morning.  This primarily included a recommendation of including some solid protein with her bedtime snack which could be done in the form of nuts.  She is doing some physical activity two to three times a week.  This includes aerobic walking with weights on her arms and her ankles.  She is likely going to need to increase frequency in this area to help support weight reduction.  Her basal metabolic rate was estimated at 1415 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements for weight maintenance are estimated at 1881 calories a day.  A 1200-calorie meal plan should support a weight loss of at least one pound a week.,PLAN:,  Recommend patient increase the frequency of her walking to five days a week.  Encouraged a 30-minute duration.  Also recommend patient include some solid protein with her bedtime snack to help address fasting blood sugar elevations.  And lastly, I encouraged caloric intake of just under 1200 calories daily.  Recommend keeping food records and tracking caloric intake.  It is unlikely that her blood sugars would drop significantly low on the current dose of Glucophage.  However, I encouraged her to be careful not to reduce calories below 1000 calories daily.  She may want to consider a multivitamin as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.",Consult - History and Phy.

The patient states that he works for ABC ABC as a temporary worker.  He worked for ABCD too.  The patient's main job was loading and unloading furniture and appliances for the home.  The patient was approximately there for about two and a half weeks.  Date of injury occurred back in October.  The patient stating that he had history of previous back problems ongoing; however, he states that on this particular day back in October, he was unloading an 18-wheeler at ABC and he was bending down picking up boxes to unload and load.  Unfortunately at this particular event, the patient had sharp pain in his lower back.  Soon afterwards, he had radiating symptoms down his right buttock all the way down to the lateral part of his leg crossing his knee.  This became progressively worse.  He also states that some of his radiating pain went down to his left leg as well.  He noticed increase in buttock spasm and also noticed spasm in his buttocks.  He initially saw Dr. Z and was provided with some muscle relaxer and was given some pain patches or Lidoderm patch, I believe.  The patient states that after this treatment, his symptoms still persisted.  At this point, the patient later on was referred to Dr. XYZ through the workmen's comp and he was initially evaluated back in April.  After the evaluation, the patient was sent for MRI, was provided with pain medications such as short-acting opioids.  He was put on restricted duty.  The MRI essentially came back negative, but the patient continued to have radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity and subsequently the patient was essentially released by Dr. XYZ in June with maximum medical improvement.,Unfortunately, the patient continued to have persistence of back pain and radiating symptoms down to his leg and went back to see Dr. XYZ again, and at this point, the patient was provided with further medication management and sent for Pain Clinic referral.  The patient also was recommended for nerve block at this point and the patient received epidural steroid injection by Dr. ABC without any significant relief.  The patient also was sent for EMG and nerve conduction study, which was performed by Dr. ABCD and the MRI, EMG, and nerve conduction study came back essentially negative for radiculopathy, which was performed by Dr. ABCD.  The patient states that he continues to have pain with extended sitting, he has radiating symptoms down to his lower extremity on the right side of his leg, increase in pain with stooping.  He has difficulty sleeping at nighttime because of increase in pain.  Ultimately, the patient was returned back to work in June, and deemed with maximum medical improvement back in June.  The patient unfortunately still has significant degree of back pain with activities such as stooping and radicular symptoms down his right leg, worse than the left side.  The patient also went to see Dr. X who is a chiropractic specialist and received eight or nine visits of chiropractic care without long-term relief in his overall radicular symptoms.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient was examined with the gown on.  Lumbar flexion was moderately decreased.  Extension was normal.  Side bending to the right was decreased.  Side bending to the left was within normal limits.  Rotation and extension to the right side was causing increasing pain.  Extension and side bending to the left was within normal limits without significant pain on the left side.  While seated, straight leg was negative on the LLE at 90° and also negative on the RLE at 90°.  There was no true root tension sign or radicular symptoms upon straight leg raising in the seated position.  In supine position, straight leg was negative in the LLE and also negative on the RLE.  Sensory exam shows there was a decrease in sensation to the S1 dermatomal distribution on the right side to light touch and at all other dermatomal distribution was within normal limits.  Deep tendon reflex at the patella was 2+/4 bilaterally, but there was a decrease in reflex in the Achilles tendon 1+/4 on the right side and essentially 2+/4 on the left side.  Medial hamstring reflex was 2+/4 on both hamstrings as well.  On prone position, there was tightness in the paraspinals and erector spinae muscle as well as tightness on the right side of the quadratus lumborum area, right side was worse than the left side.  Increase in pain at deep palpatory examination in midline of the L5 and S1 level.,MEDICAL RECORD REVIEW:,  I had the opportunity to review Dr. XYZ's medical records.  Also reviewed Dr. ABC procedural note, which was the epidural steroid injection block that was performed in December.  Also, reviewed Dr. X's medical record notes and an EMG and nerve study that was performed by Dr. ABCD, which was essentially normal.  The MRI of the lumbar spine that was performed back in April, which showed no evidence of herniated disc.,DIAGNOSIS: , Residual from low back injury with right lumbar radicular symptomatology.,EVALUATION/RECOMMENDATION:,  The patient has an impairment based on AMA Guides Fifth Edition and it is permanent.  The patient appears to have re-aggravation of the low back injury back in October related to his work at ABC when he was working unloading and loading an 18-wheel truck.  Essentially, there was a clear aggravation of his symptoms with ongoing radicular symptom down to his lower extremity mainly on the right side more so than the left.  The patient also has increase in back pain with lumbar flexion and rotational movement to the right side.  With these ongoing symptoms, the patient has also decrease in activities of daily living such as mobility as well as decrease in sleep pattern and general decrease in overall function.  Therefore, the patient is assigned 8% impairment of the whole person.  We are able to assign this utilizing the Fifth Edition on spine section on the AMA guide.  Using page 384, table 15-3, the patient does fall under DRE Lumbar Category II under criteria for rating impairment due to lumbar spine injury.  In this particular section, it states that the patient's clinical history and examination findings are compatible with specific injury; and finding may include significant muscle guarding or spasm observed at the time of examination, a symmetric loss of range of motion, or non-verifiable radicular complaints define his complaints of radicular pain without objective findings; no alteration of the structural integrity and no significant radiculopathy.  The patient also has decrease in activities of daily living; therefore, the patient is assigned at the higher impairment rating of 8% WPI.  In the future, the patient should avoid prolonged walking, standing, stooping, squatting, hip bending, climbing, excessive flexion, extension, and rotation of his back.  His one time weight limit should be determined by work trial, although the patient should continue to be closely monitored and managed for his pain control by the specific specialist for management of his overall pain.  The patient although has a clear low back pain with certain movements such as stooping and extended sitting and does have a clear radicular symptomatology, the patient also should be monitored closely for specific dependency to short-acting opioids in the near future by specialist who could monitor and closely follow his overall pain management.  The patient also should be treated with appropriate modalities and appropriate rehabilitation in the near future.,",IME-QME-Work Comp etc.

The patient was sedated and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.  The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors.  Care was taken not to injure the ilioinguinal nerve.  Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.  Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.,The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures.  The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery.,Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature.  The sac was excised and sent to Pathology.  The stump was examined and no bleeding was noted.  The ends of the suture were then cut, and the stump retracted back into the abdomen.,The floor of the inguinal canal was then strengthened by suturing the shelving edge of Poupart's ligament to the conjoined tendon using a 2-0 Prolene, starting at the pubic tubercle and running towards the internal ring.  In this manner, an internal ring was created that admitted just the tip of my smallest finger.,The Penrose drain was removed.  The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior and superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.",Surgery

The right arm, axilla, and chest wall were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Longitudinal skin incision was made from the lower axilla distally down the medial aspect of the arm and the basilic vein was not apparent.  The draining veins are the deep brachial veins.  The primary vein was carefully dissected out and small tributaries clamped, divided, and ligated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  A nice length of vein was obtained to the distal one third of the arm.  This appeared to be of adequate length to transpose the vein through the subcutaneous tissue to an old occluded fistula vein, which remains patent through a small collateral vein.  A transverse skin incision was made over the superior aspect of the old fistula vein.  This vein was carefully dissected out and encircled with vascular tapes.  The brachial vein was then tunneled in a gentle curve above the bicep to the level of the cephalic vein fistula.  The patient was sensible, was then systemically heparinized.  The existing fistula vein was clamped proximally and distally, incised longitudinally for about a centimeter.  The brachial vein end was spatulated.  Subsequently, a branchial vein to arterialized fistula vein anastomosis was then constructed using running #6-0 Prolene suture in routine fashion.  After the completion of the anastomosis, the fistula vein was forebled and the branchial vein backbled.  The anastomosis was completed.  A nice thrill could be palpated over the outflow brachial vein.  Hemostasis was noted.  A 8 mm Blake drain was placed in the wound and brought out through inferior skin stab incision and ___ the skin with #3-0 nylon suture.  The wounds were then closed using interrupted #4-0 Vicryl and deep subcutaneous tissue ___ staples closed the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then x-ray'd and taken to Recovery in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss 50 mL, drains 8 mm Blake.

Thyroid isthmusectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal, less than 25 cc.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the Emergency Department who had had multiple massive strokes.  He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending.",ENT - Otolaryngology
4291,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, right iliac vein and inferior vena cava (IVC), status post balloon angioplasty, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient was transferred here the evening of 02/23/2007 from Hospital with a new diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on confirmation by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphoblasts that afternoon.  History related to this illness probably dates back to October of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual ""lump"" posteriorly.  The left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since.  In early November, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain.  Physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved.  In December, he noted onset of increasing fatigue.  He used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities.  He has lost 10 pounds since December and feels his appetite has decreased.  Night sweats and cough began in December, for which he was treated with a course of Augmentin.  However, both of these problems have continued.  He also began taking Accutane for persistent acne in December (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).  Despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at University of Denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).,The morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain.  He was seen in Emergency Room where it was noted that he had an elevated WBC of 18,000.  CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that CT, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found.  He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.  Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.  Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected.  Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.  This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.  Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood.  These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.

The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then inserted into the patient's left naris.  The nasal mucosal membranes were dry and atrophic throughout.  There was no evidence of any mass lesions.  The nasal laryngoscope was then advanced towards the posterior aspect of the nasal cavity.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.  The nasolaryngoscopy continued to be advanced into the oropharynx and the vallecula and the base of the tongue were evaluated and were without evidence of mass lesion or ulceration.,The fiberoptic scope was further advanced and visualization of the larynx revealed some atrophic, dry, supraglottic, and glottic changes.  There was no evidence of any local mass lesion, nodule, or ulcerations.  There was no evidence of any erythema.  Upon phonation, the vocal cords approximated completely and upon inspiration, the true vocal cords were abducted in a normal fashion and was symmetric.  The airway was stable and patent throughout the entire examination.  The nasal laryngoscope was then slowly withdrawn from the supraglottic region and the scope was further advanced into the oropharynx and nasopharynx.  The eustachian tube was completely visualized and was patent without obstruction.  The scope was then further removed without difficulty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , The patient would benefit from Ocean nasal spray as well as bacitracin ointment applied to the anterior naris.  At this time, we were unable to discontinue the patient's inhaled steroids that she is using for her asthma.  If this becomes possible in the future, this may provide her some relief of her chronic dysphonia.  The patient is to follow up with Department of Otolaryngology after discharge from the hospital for further evaluation of these problems.",Surgery

574,"PROCEDURE: , Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 2-year, 2-month-old little girl who presented to the hospital with severe anemia, hemoglobin 5.8, elevated total bilirubin consistent with hemolysis and weak positive direct Coombs test.  She was transfused with packed red blood cells.  Her hemolysis seemed to slow down.  She also on presentation had indications of urinary tract infection with urinalysis significant for 2+ leukocytes, positive nitrites, 3+ protein, 3+ blood, 25 to 100 white cells, 10 to 25 bacteria, 10 to 25 epithelial cells on clean catch specimen.  Culture subsequently grew out no organisms; however, the child had been pretreated with amoxicillin about x3 doses prior to presentation to the hospital.  She had a blood culture, which was also negative.  She was empirically started on presentation with the cefotaxime intravenously.  Her white count on presentation was significantly elevated at 20,800, subsequently increased to 24.7 and then decreased to 16.6 while on antibiotics.  After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present.  She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI.,I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures.  The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression.  Questions were answered to their satisfaction.  They would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After ""time out"" procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained.  She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself.  She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied.  She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision.  Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact.  The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained.  The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied.  Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back.,During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable.

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  Intraabdominal findings revealed a small uterus approximately 2 cm in size.  The ovaries were atrophic consistent with menopause.  The liver margins and stomach were palpated and found to be normal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and administered a spinal anesthesia for postoperative pain control.  She was then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and administered general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and an indwelling Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.  At this point, the patient was evaluated for a possible vaginal hysterectomy.  She was nulliparous and the pelvis was narrow.  After the anesthesia was administered, the patient was repeatedly stooling and therefore because of these two reasons, the decision was made to do an abdominal hysterectomy.  After the patient was prepped and draped, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  The second scalpel was used to dissect out to the underlying layer of fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was grasped with Ochsners, tented up and underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  In a similar fashion, the inferior portion of the rectus fascia was tented up, dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated bluntly in the midline and the peritoneum was identified and entered with the Metzenbaum.  The peritoneal incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the above findings were noted and the GYN Balfour retractor was placed.  Moist laparotomy sponges were used to pack the bowel out of the operative field.  The bladder blade and the extension for the retractor were then placed.  An Allis was used on the uterus for retraction.  The round ligaments were then identified, clamped with two hemostats and transected and then suture ligated.  The anterior portion of the broad ligament was dissected along vesicouterine resection.  The bladder was then dissected off the anterior cervix and vagina without difficulty.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments on both sides were then doubly clamped using hemostats, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The uterine vessels on both sides were skeletonized and clamped with two hemostats and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was assured.  The cardinal ligaments on both sides were clamped using a curved hemostat, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  Two hemostats were then placed just under the cervix meeting in the midline.  The uterus and cervix were then _______ off using a scalpel.  This was handed and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Using #0 Vicryl suture, the right vaginal cuff angle was closed and affixed to the ipsilateral cardinal ligament.  A baseball stitch was then used to close the cuff to the midline.  The same was done to the left vaginal cuff angle, which was affixed to the ipsilateral and cardinal ligaments.  The baseball stitch was used to close the cuff to the midline.  The hemostats were removed and the cuff was closed and good hemostasis was noted.  The uterosacral ligaments were also transfixed to the cuff and brought out for good support by using a #0 Vicryl suture through each uterosacral ligament and incorporating this into the vaginal cuff.  The pelvis was then copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  Good support and hemostasis was noted.  The bowel packing was then removed and the GYN Balfour retractor was moved.  The peritoneum was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was then closed using #0 Vicryl in a running fashion, marking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure and an Op-Site was placed over this.  The patient was then brought out of general anesthesia and extubated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She will follow up postoperatively as an inpatient.",Obstetrics / Gynecology

The working diagnosis is lymphoma, however, the Hematology and Oncology Departments were requesting a lymph node biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis as well as prognosis.  Thus, the patient was scheduled for a lymph node biopsy with platelets running secondary to thrombocytopenia at the time of surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a large right axillary lymphadenopathy, one of the lymph node was sent down as a fresh specimen.,PROCEDURE:  ,After informed written consent, risks and benefits of this procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  Multiple lymph nodes were palpated in the right axilla, however, the most inferior node was to be removed.  First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine solution.  Next, using a #15 blade scalpel, an incision was made approximately 4 cm in length transversally in the inferior axilla.  Next, using electro Bovie cautery, maintaining hemostasis, dissection was carried down to the lymph node.  The lymph node was then completely excised using electro Bovie cautery as well as hemostats to maintain hemostasis and then lymph node was sent to specimen fresh to the lab.  Several hemostats were used, suture ligated with #3-0 Vicryl suture and hemostasis was maintained.  Next the deep dermal layers were approximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  After the wound has been copiously irrigated, the skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture and the pathology is pending.  The patient did tolerated the procedure well.

It was accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath.  The patient was felt to be a candidate for mitral valve repair versus mitral valve replacement and underwent a stress test as part of his evaluation for chest pain.  He underwent adenosine Cardiolite, which revealed 2 mm ST segment depression in leads II, III aVF, and V3, V4, and V5.  Stress images revealed left ventricular dilatations suggestive of multivessel disease.  He is undergoing evaluation today as a part of preoperative evaluation and because of the positive stress test.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, benefits, alternatives of the above mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained both verbally and writing.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where the procedure was performed.  The right inguinal area was sterilely cleansed with a Betadine solution and the patient was draped in the usual manner.  1% lidocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right inguinal area.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.,The guidewire was then advanced through the lumen of the needle without resistance and a small nick was made in the skin.  The needle was removed and a pressure was held.  A #6 French arterial sheath was advanced over the guidewire without resistance.  The dilator and guidewire were removed and the sheath was flushed.  A Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary artery was carefully engaged and limited evaluation was performed after noticing that the patient had a significant left main coronary artery stenosis.  The catheter was withdrawn from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and the guidewire was inserted through the tip of the catheter.  The catheter was removed over guidewire and a Judkins right #4 catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the right coronary artery was carefully engaged and using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary artery was evaluated in both diagonal views.  This catheter was removed.  The sheath was flushed the final time.  The patient was taken to the postcatheterization holding area in stable condition.,FINDINGS:,LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY:,  This vessel is seen to be heavily calcified throughout its course.

He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.,Pericardium was opened and suspended.  Pursestring sutures were placed.  Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.,PDA was exposed first.  The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD.  LAD was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.,Two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene.  The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  Temporary V-pacing wires were placed.  Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine.  Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  Hemostasis was assured.  Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.

He was treated for a large transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with TURBT in 2002 and subsequently underwent chemotherapy because of pulmonary nodules.  He has had some low grade noninvasive small tumor recurrences on one or two occasions over the past 18 months.  Recent cystoscopy raises suspicion of another recurrence.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The entire bladder was actually somewhat erythematous with mucosa looking somewhat hyperplastic particularly in the right dome and lateral wall of the bladder.  Scarring was noted along the base of the bladder from the patient's previous cysto TURBT.  Ureteral orifice on the right side was not able to be identified.  The left side was unremarkable.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  He was placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was administered after which the patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The genitalia and lower abdomen were prepared with Betadine and draped subsequently.  The urethra and bladder were inspected under video urology equipment (25 French panendoscope) with the findings as noted above.  Cup biopsies were taken in two areas from the right lateral wall of the bladder, the posterior wall of bladder, and the bladder neck area.  Each of these biopsy sites were fulgurated with Bugbee electrodes.  Inspection of the sites after completing the procedure revealed no bleeding and bladder irrigant was clear.  The patient's bladder was then emptied.  Cystoscope removed and the patient was awakened and transferred to the postanesthetic recovery area.  There were no apparent complications, and the patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was less than 15 mL.",Surgery

Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.,Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.,Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.,At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.",Surgery

Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor.,4.  Microtechniques for all the above.,5.  Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago.  A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation.  She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair.  Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression.  She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed.  Consequently, this operation is performed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol.  She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.  She was well padded, secured, and so forth.  The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.  The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint.  This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system.  Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.  A biparietal incision was performed.  A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.  A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system.  The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.  An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.  This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.  The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.  At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.  Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled.  Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.,Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area.  A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.  Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.  A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.  A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.  It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.  Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.  The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa.  Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.,At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly.  The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator.  A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.,I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter.,Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.,The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.  The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon.  The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue.  Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.  Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.,For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound.  The bone flap was brought on to the field.  The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon.  At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place.  The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses.,Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates.  The wound was then closed in layers.  The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L.  The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid.,Nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady.",Surgery

1549,"MEDICATIONS: , Plavix, atenolol, Lipitor, and folic acid.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,This is a 41-year-old male patient who comes in with chest pain, had had a previous MI in 07/2003 and stents placement in 2003, who comes in for a stress myocardial perfusion scan.,With the patient at rest, 10.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.,PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION:  ,The patient exercised for a total of 12 minutes on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 12.8 METS.  The resting heart rate was 57 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 123 beats per minute, which was 69% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with a resting blood pressure of 130/100 and a peak blood pressure of 158/90.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and leg pain.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm.  The peak stress EKG did not reveal any ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities.  There was ventricular bigeminy seen during exercise, but no sustained tachycardia was seen.  At peak, there was no chest pain noted.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and left pain.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting myocardial perfusion imaging.,MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:,1.  The overall quality of the scan was good.,2.  There was no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.,3.  The left ventricular cavity appeared normal in size.,4.  Gated SPECT images revealed mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.,CONCLUSIONS:,1.  Good exercise tolerance.,2.  Less than adequate cardiac stress.  The patient was on beta-blocker therapy.,3.  No EKG evidence of stress induced ischemia.,4.  No chest pain with stress.,5.  Mild ventricular bigeminy with exercise.,6.  No diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.,7.

248,"PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",Surgery
1457,"PROCEDURE: , EEG during wakefulness demonstrates background activity consisting of moderate-amplitude beta activity seen bilaterally.  The EEG background is symmetric.  Independent, small, positive, sharp wave activity is seen in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally with sharp-slow wave discharges seen more predominantly in the right frontotemporal head region.  No clinical signs of involuntary movements are noted during synchronous video monitoring.  Recording time is 22 minutes and 22 seconds.  There is attenuation of the background, faster activity during drowsiness and some light sleep is recorded.  No sustained epileptogenic activity is evident, but the independent bilateral sharp wave activity is seen intermittently.  Photic stimulation induced a bilaterally symmetric photic driving response.,IMPRESSION:,  EEG during wakefulness and light sleep is abnormal with independent, positive sharp wave activity seen in both frontotemporal head regions, more predominant in the right frontotemporal region.  The EEG findings are consistent with potentially epileptogenic process.  Clinical correlation is warranted.",Sleep Medicine

The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.,PMH:, 1)4Vessel CABG and pacemaker placement, 4/84. 2)Hypercholesterolemia. 3)Bipolar Affective D/O.,FHX: ,HTN, Colon CA, and a daughter with unknown type of ""dystonia."",SHX:, Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.,ROS:, no recent weight loss/fever/chills/night sweats/CP/SOB.

Brain CT revealed 1.0 x 1.5 cm area of calcific density within the medial two-thirds of the left cerebral peduncle. This shows no mass effect, but demonstrates mild contrast enhancement. There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma).,No surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed. He was lost to follow-up in 1993.",Radiology
4259,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old man referred for neurological consultation by Dr. X.  The patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter.  He provides a small portion of his history; however, his family provides virtually all of it.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , He has trouble with walking and balance, with bladder control, and with thinking and memory.  When I asked him to provide me detail, he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder.  He is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory.,According to his family, he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years.  At first, they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground (for example, gardening) he was not able to get up by himself.  They did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time, but because there was no improvement over two weeks, they resumed the statin.  As time progressed, he developed more and more difficulty.  He started to shuffle.  He started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since July of 2006.  At this point, he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat.  He frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.  He frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car, always shuffles or scuffs his feet, always has trouble turning or changing direction, always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs, and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking.  He has not fallen in the last month.  He did fall earlier, but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall.  His family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances.  He has no stairs in his home, however, his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs.  His handwriting has become smaller and shakier.,In regard to the bladder, he states, ""I wet the bed.""  In talking with his family, it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder.  He was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005.  This was treated by Dr. Y.  Dr. X does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patient's urinary incontinence.  The patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years.  His wife states that they go through two or three of them per day.  He has been placed on medications; however, they have not helped.,He has no headaches or sensation of head fullness.,In regard to the thinking and memory, at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.  Now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself.  His wife took over his medications about two years ago.  She stopped his driving about three years ago.  She discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more.  Apparently, he did not object.  At this point, he frequently has trouble with memory, orientation, and everyday problems solving at home.  He needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth, put on his clothes, and so forth.  He is a retired office machine repairman.  He is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day.,He has not had PT or OT and has not been treated with medications for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.  He has been treated for the bladder.  He has not had lumbar puncture.,Past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that I reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985, hypercholesterolemia since 1997, and diabetes since 1998.  The bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively.  He has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.  He had a period of depression in 1999 and was on Prozac for a while, but this was then stopped.  He used to drink a significant amount of alcohol.  This was problematic enough that his wife was concerned.  She states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,He quit smoking in 1968.  His current weight is 183 pounds.  His tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,His grandfather had arthritis.  His father had Parkinson's disease.

There is no scoliosis.,Skin:  No neurocutaneous stigmata.,Cardiovascular Examination:  No carotid or vertebral bruits.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 17/30.  He did not know the year, season, or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor.  There was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation.  He could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  No evidence of papilledema.  The pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus, facial expression and sensation, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength, but the tone is marked by significant paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, or drift.  There is tremulousness of the outstretched hands.,Sensory Exam:  Is difficult to interpret.

It shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm.  The 3rd ventricle contour is flat.  The span is enlarged at 12 mm.  The sylvian aqueduct is patent.  There is a pulsation artifact.  The corpus callosum is effaced.  There are extensive T2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata.  There are also scattered T2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia.  There is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy.  There is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.

His headaches progressively worsened, especially in the past two months prior to this presentation. For 2 weeks prior to his 1/25/93 evaluation at UIHC, he would awake screaming. His parent spoke with a local physician who thought this might be due to irritability secondary to pinworms and,Vermox was prescribed and arrangements were made for a neurologic evaluation. On the evening of 1/24/93 the patient awoke screaming and began to vomit. This was followed by a 10 min period of tonic-clonic type movements and postictal lethargy.

Prior cerebrovascular accident.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,250 cc.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The common and internal carotid arteries were opened.  A high-grade narrowing was present at the proximal internal carotid and this tapered well to a slightly small diameter internal carotid.  This was repaired with a Dacron patch and the patient tolerated this well under regional anesthetic without need for shunting.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  Longitudinal incisions were made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, carried down through subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The platysmal muscle was divided.  The carotid sheath was identified and opened.  The vagus nerve, ansa cervicalis, and hypoglossal nerves were identified and avoided.  The common internal and external carotids were then freed from the surrounding tissue.  At this point, 10,000 units of aqueous heparin were administered and allowed to take effect.  The external and common carotids were then clamped.  The patient's neurological status was evaluated and found to be unchanged from preoperative levels.,Once sufficient time had lapsed, we proceeded with the procedure.  The carotid bulb was opened with a #11 blade and extended with Potts scissors through the very tight lesion into normal internal carotid.  The plaque was then sharply excised proximally and an eversion endarterectomy was performed successfully at the external.  The plaque tapered nicely on the internal and no tacking sutures were necessary.  Heparinized saline was injected and no evidence of flapping or other debris was noted.  The remaining carotid was examined under magnification, which showed no debris of flaps present.  At this point, a Dacron patch was brought on to the field, cut to appropriate length and size, and anastomosed to the artery using #6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Prior to the time of last stitch, the internal carotid was back-bled through this.  The last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The internal was again gently occluded while flow was restored to the common and external carotids for several moments and then flow was restored to the entire system.  At this point, a total of 50 mg of Protamine was administered and allowed to take effect.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and closed in layers using #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The patient was then taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well.  Sponge, needles, and instrument count were correct.

The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis.  CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.

The patient had a positive hCG with a negative sonogram and hCG titer of about 18,000.,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  The patient was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of a possible incomplete abortion, to rule out ectopic pregnancy or rupture of corpus luteal cyst.  The patient was kept in observation for 24 hours.  The sonogram stated there was no gestational sac, but there was a small mass within the uterus that could represent a gestational sac.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  A repeat hCG titer done on the same day came back as 15,000, but then the following day, it came back as 18,000.  The diagnosis of a possible ruptured ectopic pregnancy was established.  The patient was taken to surgery and a laparotomy was performed with findings of a right ruptured ectopic pregnancy.  The right salpingectomy was performed with no complications.  The patient received 2 units of red packed cells.  On admission, her hemoglobin was 12.9, then in the afternoon it dropped to 8.1, and the following morning, it was 7.9.

Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed.  Bladder was emptied.  Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done.  Incision was made.  A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa.  The bladder cystocele was reduced.  Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal.  Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision.  The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed.  The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra.,The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material.  The urethra was coapted very nicely.  At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder.  There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings.  The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair.  The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond.  Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement.  The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  After closure, Premarin cream was applied.  The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop.

The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was then used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin and its pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  A #6 French sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Next, angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle.  The guidewire was then removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  LVEDP was then measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  The left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO position with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  LVEDP was then remeasured.  Pullback was then performed, which failed to reveal an LVAO gradient.  The catheter was then removed.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was removed.  Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the saphenous vein graft was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  The saphenous vein graft was visualized in several different views.  The Judkins right catheter was then advanced and the native coronary artery was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  Right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was retracted.  We were unable to engage the left subclavian artery thus the catheter was removed over an exchange wire.  Next, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the exchange wire.  The wire was then easily passed into the left subclavian artery.  The multipurpose catheter was then removed.  LIMA catheter was then exchanged over the wire into the left subclavian artery.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  LIMA graft was then engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  The LIMA graft was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the LIMA catheter was retracted under fluoroscopic guidance.  The sheath was flushed for the final time.  The patient was returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition.,FINDINGS:,LEFT VENTRICULOGRAM: , There is no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%.

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.",Neurosurgery

The patient had a marked dorsal hump, which was both bony and cartilaginous in nature.,2.  The patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump.,3.  The patient had a C-shaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosis.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 months with the second episode 2 weeks following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity.  The patient was evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint was his cosmetic deformity.  He was found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left as well as some tip ptosis.  The patient was recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch was placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient was subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube was then secured, and the table was then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum was then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure was begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision was made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision was then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision was completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there was a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection was then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilages and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer was used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which was made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There was also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There was also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin was contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele was attempted to be dissected free, most of which was removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump was taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This was passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There was now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty was then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial planes were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage was incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage was then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage was passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut grafts measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader grafts were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomies were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bones were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut was then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It was approximately 15 mm long.  This was placed, and a pocket was just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket was taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft was placed.  The intradermal sutures were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal sutures were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut was then sutured in place to the medial crura after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crura in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin was also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut was then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This was done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage was wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture was placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay was then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture was brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft was then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing sutures inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this was done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping was performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformities as well as placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this was sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum was reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision was closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.  Doyle splints were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 3-0 monofilament suture.  The columellar skin was reapproximated using interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures, and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin was closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures.,At the end of the procedure, all sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct.  A Denver external splint was then applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and transported to Anesthesia Care Unit in good condition.",Surgery

Left hip arthroscopic femoral neck osteoplasty.,3.  Left hip arthroscopic labral repair.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general anesthetic.  His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table.  His right leg was placed first.  The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction.  Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken.  A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken.  Gentle traction was applied.  Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained.  Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization.  The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum.  For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized.  This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair.  The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot.  After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable.  The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable.  The posterior leg was stable.  The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified.  A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly.  This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion.  A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression.  The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip.  The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon.  The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.

1754,"3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION,This patient is undergoing 3-dimensionally planned radiation therapy in order to adequately target structures at risk while diminishing the degree of exposure to uninvolved adjacent normal structures.  This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects.  With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived.  Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician.  Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the  immobilization device.,The patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are performed through the targeted area.  The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images.  The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures.  This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features.  Appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures.,Once appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised.  If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated.,In view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470.",Radiology

Proximal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral fifth toes.,3.  Distal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral third and fourth toes.,4.  Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.  She is to ice and elevate both feet today and rest as much as possible.,Physical Therapy will teach her crutch training today.  X-rays were taken in the postoperative area and revealed excellent position of the screws and correction of bunion deformity as well as the hammertoe deformities.",Surgery

Surgically, the patient has an enlarged fibroid uterus with a large fundal/anterior fibroids, which is approximately 6+ cm and several small submucosal fibroids within the endometrium.  Both ovaries and tubes appeared within normal limits.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where she was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position.  After the general anesthetic was found to be adequate, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife.  This was carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline with the second knife and the fascial incision was then extended laterally in both directions with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying layer of rectus muscle bluntly.  It was then dissected in the middle with the Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of this incision was addressed in a similar manner.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified with hemostat clamps, tented up, and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Metzenbaum scissors and then extended bluntly.  Next, the uterus was grasped bluntly and removed from the abdomen.  The fundal fibroid was identified.  It was then injected with vasopressin, 20 units mixed in 30 cc of normal saline along the serosal surface and careful to aspirate to avoid any blood vessels.  15 cc was injected.  Next, the point tip was used with the cautery _______ cutting to cut the linear incision along the top of the _______ fibroid until fibroid fibers were seen.  The edges of the myometrium was grasped with Allis clamps, tented up, and a hemostat was used to bluntly dissect around the fibroid followed by blunt dissection with a finger.  The fibroid was easily and bluntly dissected out.  It was also grasped with Lahey clamp to prevent traction.  Once the blunt dissection of the large fibroid was complete, it was handed off to the scrub nurse.  The large fibroid traversed the whole myometrium down to the mucosal surface and the endometrial cavity was largely entered when this fibroid was removed.  At this point, several smaller fibroids were noticed along the endometrial surface of the uterus.  Three of these were removed just by bluntly grasping with the Lahey clamp and twisting, all three of these were approximately 1 cm to 2 cm in size.  These were also handed to the scrub tech.  Next, the uterine incision was then closed with first two interrupted layers of #0 chromic in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion and then with a #0 Vicryl in a running baseball stitch.  The uterus was seen to be completely hemostatic after closure.  Next, a 3 x 4 inch piece of Interceed was placed over the incision and dampened with normal saline.  The uterus was then carefully returned to the abdomen and being careful not to disturb the Interceed.  Next, the greater omentum was replaced over the uterus.,The rectus muscles were then reapproximated with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl in the midline.  Then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Next, the Scarpa's fascia was closed with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The incision was then dressed with 0.5-inch Steri-Strips and bandaged appropriately.  After the patient was cleaned, she was taken to Recovery in stable condition and she will be followed for her immediate postoperative period during the hospital.",Obstetrics / Gynecology

Uterine cavity sounding to 10 cm, normal appearing tubal ostia bilaterally, fluffy endometrium, normal appearing cavity without obvious polyps or fibroids.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, where general anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A speculum was placed into the vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum and a paracervical block was performed using 20 ml of 0.50% lidocaine with 1:200,000 of epinephrine.,The cervical vaginal junction at the 4 o'clock position was injected and 5 ml was instilled.  The block was performed at 8 o'clock as well with 5 ml at 10 and 2 o'clock.  The lidocaine was injected into the cervix.  The cervix was minimally dilated with #17 Hanks dilator.  The 5-mm 30-degree hysteroscope was then inserted under direct visualization using lactated Ringer's as a distention medium.  The uterine cavity was viewed and the above normal findings were noted.  The Essure tubal occlusion was then inserted through the operative port and the tip of the Essure device easily slid into the right ostia.  The coil was advanced and easily placed and the device withdrawn.  There were three coils into the uterine cavity after removal of the insertion device.  The device was removed and reloaded.  The advice was to advance under direct visualization and the tip was inserted into the left ostia.  This passed easily and the device was inserted.  It was removed easily and three coils again were into the uterine cavity.  The hysteroscope was then removed and the ThermaChoice ablation was performed.  The uterus was then sounded to 9.5 to 10 cm.  The ThermaChoice balloon was primed and pressure was drawn to a negative 150.  The device was then moistened and inserted into the uterine cavity and the balloon was slowly filled with 40 ml of D5W.  The pressure was brought up to 170 and the cycle was initiated.  A full cycle of eight minutes was performed.  At no time there was a significant loss of pressure from the catheter balloon.  After the cycle was complete, the balloon was deflated and withdrawn.  The tenaculum was withdrawn.  No bleeding was noted.  The patient was then awakened, transferred, and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",Surgery

Arthrotomy.,5.  Bankart lesion repair.,6.  Capsular shift, left shoulder (Mitek suture anchors; absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures).,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient was seen multiple times preoperatively and found to have chronic instability of her shoulder.  Risks and benefits of the procedure had been discussed in length including but not exclusive of infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, continued instability, recurrent instability, medical complications, surgical complications, and anesthesia complications.  The patient understood and wishes to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Anterior instability, left shoulder.,POSTOP DIAGNOSES:,1.  Anterior instability, left shoulder.,2.  Grade 4 chondromalacia, 10% humeral head, chondral defect 1 cm squared, left shoulder.,3.  Type 1 superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion, left shoulder.,4.  Anteroinferior glenoid erosions 10% bony surface, left shoulder.,5.  Bankart lesion, left shoulder.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in a supine position and both shoulders examined systematically.  She had full range of motion with no joint adhesions.  She had equal range of motion bilaterally.  She had Hawkins 2 anteriorly and posteriorly in both shoulders with a grade 1 sulcus sign in both shoulders.  This was the same when the arm was in neutral or in external rotation.  The patient was then turned to right lateral decubitus position, axillary roll was placed, and beanbag was inflated.  Peroneal nerve was well protected.  All bony prominences were well protected.,The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient was given antibiotics well before the start of the procedure to decrease the risk of infection.  The arm was placed in a arm holder with 10 pounds of traction.  A posterior portal was created in the usual manner by isolating gently with the spinal needle, it was insufflated with 30 cubic centimeters of saline.  A small incision was made after infiltrating the skin with Marcaine and epinephrine.  The scope was introduced into the shoulder with no difficulty.  It was then examined systematically.  The patient did have diffuse synovitis throughout her shoulder.  Her posterior humeral head showed an enlarged bold spot with some other areas of chondromalacia on the posterior head.  She also had an area 1 cm in diameter, which was on more central portion of the head and more inferiorly which appeared to be more of an impaction-type injury.  This had some portions of fibrillated and loose cartilage, hanging from the edges.  These were later debrided, but the dissection was proximally 10 to 15% of the humeral surface.,The biceps tendon appeared to be normal.  The supraspinatus, infraspinatus tendons were normal.  The inferior pouch was normal with no capsular tearing and no HAGL lesions.  The posteroinferior labrum was normal as well as the posterosuperior labrum.  There was some fraying in the posterosuperior labrum, which was later debrided.  It was found essentially to be a type 1 lesion anteriorly and superiorly.  The anterosuperior labrum appeared to be detached, which appeared to be more consistent with a sublabral hole.  The middle glenohumeral ligament was present as an entire sheath, but attach to the labrum.  The labrum did appeared to be detached from the anterior glenoid from the 11 o'clock position all the way down to the 6 o'clock position.  The biceps anchor itself was later probed and found to be stable and normal.  The subscapularis tendon was normal.  The anterior band of the glenohumeral ligament was present, but it was clearly avulsed off the glenoid.  There was some suggestion of anteroinferior bony erosions, which was later substantiated when the shoulder was opened.  The patient was missing about 10 to 15% of her anteroinferior glenoid rim.  The patient had a positive drive-through sign.,The arm was then moved to lateral and placed through range of motion.  There was contact of the rotator cuff to the superior glenoid in flexion at 115 degrees, maximum flexion was 150 degrees.  The arm abducted and externally rotated.  There was contact to the rotator cuff with posterosuperior labrum.  This occurred with the arm position of 90 degrees with abduction at 55 degrees of external rotation.  It should be noted that the maximum abduction is 150 degrees and with the arm abducted 90 degrees, maximum external rotation was 95 degrees.  The patient did have a positive relocation maneuver.  The posterior labrum did appear to tilt-off, but did not appear to peel off.,The arm was then placed back in the arm holder.  Anterior portal was created with Wissinger rod.  A blue cannula was inserted into the shoulder without difficulty.  Shaver was introduced in the labrum.  Also the area of chondromalacia as mentioned above was debrided.  The labrum was found to be stable with only a type 1 SLAP lesion, and there was no evidence as there was really a type 2 SLAP lesion.  The instruments were then removed along with excess fluid.  The posterior portals were closed with single 4-0 nylon suture.  The anterior portal was left open.  The patient was then placed in a supine position, and the extremity was reprepped and draped in anticipation of performing open capsular shift.,The patient's anterior incision made just lateral to the coracoid in the skin line.  Mediolateral skin flaps were developed, and cephalic vein was identified and protected throughout the case.  The interval was developed down the clavipectoral fascia.  The conjoined tendon was retracted medially and the deltoid laterally.  The patient's subscapularis was intact, and the subscapularis split was then made between the upper one half and lower one half in line with muscle fibers.  The capsule could easily be detached from the muscle, and the interval developed very easily.  A retractor was placed inferiorly to protect the axillary nerve.  Then Gelpi retractor was used to hold the subscapularis split open.,Next, an arthrotomy was made down at the 9 o'clock position.  The labrum was identified and found to be attached all the way down to 6 o'clock position.  The inferior flap was then created in a usual manner and tied with a 0 Vicryl suture.  The patient's glenoid rim did have some erosion as mentioned above with some bone loss and flattening.  This was debrided with the soft tissue.  Three Mitek suture anchors were then placed into the glenoid rim right at the margin of articular cartilage to the scapular neck.  These were absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures.  They had excellent fixation once they had been placed.,Next, the capsular shift and Bankart repair were performed in the usual manner with the number 2 Ti-Cron sutures as an outside in and then inside out technique.  This brought the capsule right up to the edge of the glenoid rim.  With the arm in internal rotation and posterior pressure on the head, the capsule was then secured to the rim with no difficulty under direct visualization.  The capsule did come right up into the joint as expected with this type of repair.  The superior flap was then closed, the inferior flap over the superior anchor.  The interval between two flaps was closed with multiple number 2 Ti-Cron sutures.  Once this has been completed, there was no tension on the repair with the arm to side until 10 degrees of external rotation was reached.  The arm abducted 90 degrees.  There was tension on the repair until 20 degrees of external rotation reached.,The wound was thoroughly irrigated throughout with antibiotic-impregnated irrigation.  The subscapularis split was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The deep subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The superficial subcutaneous tissues were closed with number 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with 4-0 subcuticular Prolene, reinforced with Steri-Strips.  A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and a shoulder immobilizer.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.",Surgery

Her symptoms progressed and she presented to the emergency room at Brighton Gardens where a chest x-ray revealed evolving right lobar infiltrate.  She was started on antibiotics.  Infectious Disease was consulted.  She was initially begun on vancomycin.  Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were obtained; the results of which were negative for infection.  She was switched to IV Levaquin and received IV Flagyl for possible C. diff colitis as well as possible cholecystitis.  During her hospital stay, she initially was extremely relatively hypotensive with mild symptoms and she became dizzy with upright positioning.  Her systolic blood pressure was 60-70 mmHg despite rather aggressive IV fluid management up to 250 mL an hour.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. Y who monitored her fluid and pulmonary treatment.  Due to some elevated liver function tests, she was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  An ultrasound was negative; however, she did undergo CT scan of the chest and abdomen and there was a suspicion of fluid circling the gallbladder.  A HIDA scan was performed and revealed no evidence of gallbladder dysfunction.  Liver functions were monitored throughout her stay and while elevated, did reduce to approximately 1.5 times normal value.  She also was seen in consultation by Infectious Disease who followed her for several days and agreed with current management of antibiotics.  Over her week-stay, the patient was moderately hypoxemic with room air pulse oximetry of 90%.  She was placed on incentive spirometry and over the succeeding days, she did have improved pulmonary function.,LABORATORY TESTS: , Initially revealed a white count of 13,000, however, approximately 24 hours following admission her white count stabilized and in fact remained normal throughout her stay.  Blood cultures were negative at 5 days.  Sputum culture was negative.  Urine culture was negative and thoracentesis culture negative at 24 hours.  The patient did receive 2 units of packed red cells with the hemoglobin drop to 9 for cardiovascular support, as no evidence of GI bleeding was obtained.  Her most recent blood work on 6/14/2009 revealed a white count of 7000 and hemoglobin of 12.1 with a hematocrit of 36.8.  Her PT and PTT were normal.  Occult blood studies were negative for occult blood.  Hepatitis B antigen was negative.  Hepatitis A antibody IgM was negative.  Hepatitis B core IgM negative, and hepatitis C core antibody was negative.  At the time of discharge on 6/14/2009, sodium was 135, potassium was 3.7, calcium was 8.0, her ALT was 109, AST was 70, direct bilirubin was 0.2, LDH was 219, serum iron was 7, total iron unbound 183, and ferritin level was 267.,At the time of discharge, the patient had improved.  She complained of some back discomfort and lumbosacral back x-ray did reveal some evidence of mild degenerative disk disease with no obvious compression fracture acute noted and she will be followed by Dr. Z.",Discharge Summary

He had a hernia repair done on the right in the past, but developed a new hernia on the right and a smaller on the left.  The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in the supine position.  IV antibiotics were given.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A right inguinal incision was made in the previous incisional site with a 15-blade knife, extended down through the subcutaneous tissue and Scarpa fascia with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.,The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised.  There was a moderate amount of scar tissue noted, but we were able to incise that and go down into the right inguinal canal.  Upon dissection there, we did not find any hernias; however, he did have a fairly sizable hydrocele.  We went down towards the external ring and found that this was indeed tight without any hernias.,We then closed up the external oblique fascia and made an incision after doing a shave on the right and left scrotum into the upper scrotal sac with a curvilinear incision with a 15-blade knife.  We then extended down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The hydrocele sac was visualized and then drained after incising into it with a curved Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis was then delivered and found to have a moderate amount of scar tissue with a calcified appendix testis, which was then excised and sent to pathology.  We then checked the upper aspect of the tunica vaginalis pouch and found that there was indeed no other connection, was up above, so we then wrapped the sac around the back of the testis, and closed it with a 4-0 chromic suture in a Lord maneuver.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic and placed the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then used an ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation on both incisional areas with 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine; 15 mL was given.,We performed a similar procedure on the left, incising it at the scrotal area first, rather than below, and found this tunica vaginalis, and dissected it in a similar fashion and cauterized the appendix testis, which was not torsed.  This was a smaller hydrocele, but because of the __________ shunt, we went up above and found that there was a very small connection, which was then dissected off the cord structures gently, twisted upon itself, suture ligated with a 2-0 Vicryl suture.,The ilioinguinal nerve block and other wound instillations again with 15 mL total of 0.25% Marcaine were then done by the surgeon as well.  The external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 2-0 Vicryl.  4-0 chromic was then used to close the Scarpa fascia.  The skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  The scrotal incisions were closed with a subcutaneous and dartos closure using 4-0 chromic.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on all 4 incisions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.",Surgery

Mumford procedure left shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting.  After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side.  All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum.  The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact.  Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis.  Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in.  A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out.  Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff.  Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was directed subacromially.  A portal was created laterally.  Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver.  #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this.,It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200.  Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure.  Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured.  An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Flaps were created.  Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly.  Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp.  An excellent decompression was present.  CA ligament had been previously resected.  We then took the incision over the distal clavicle.  The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw.  The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges.  Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl.  Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same.  A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing.  0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure.  Pain buster catheter was hooked up.  The patient's arm was placed in arm sling.  He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.",Surgery

Low anterior colon resection.,3.  Flexible colonoscopy.,4.  Transverse loop colostomy and JP placement.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,This 74-year-old female who had a recent hip fracture and the patient was in rehab when she started having some stool coming out of the urethra.  The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula.  Recommendation for a surgery was made.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter.  They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure.  All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic.  An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia.  The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.,Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall.  At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad.  The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen.  The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation.  At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess.  When the small bowel was completely freed of  abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus.  The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized.  At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum.  At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed.  Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired.  The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology.  Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis.  A pursestring device was fired.  The staple line was cut.  The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied.  At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced.  The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient.  ,Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom.  It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches.  Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air.  No air was seen evolving from the staple line.  All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken.  The scope was removed at this point.  The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula.  Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon.  After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again.  More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area.  The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.,This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin.  The wire was passed under the transverse colon.  It was left in place.  Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis.  At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied.  Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue.  Copious amount of irrigation was used.  The skin was approximated with staples.  At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made.  The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge.  One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened.  As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well.  At this point, dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The stent from the left ureter was removed and the Foley was left in place.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed up during the hospitalization.",Surgery

At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but falls often.  He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizures were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  His seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise.  He does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures.  He denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  There is no numbness or loss of skills.  He has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias.  He has no oropharyngeal complaints.  Visual or auditory complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Also positive for some mild scoliosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with mother, father, and 2 other siblings.

His speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together.  He is about 50% understandable at best.  He does put words and sentences together.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  His extraocular movements are intact.  His visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  His face shows left facial weakness postictally.  His palate elevates midline.  Vision is intact bilaterally.  Tongue protrudes midline.,Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  Right upper extremity is much more on target.  His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.  They are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call EMS at any point during that time.  Hopefully at home, they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of Topamax will prevent them.  Other medication options would include Keppra, Zonegran or Lamictal.,FOLLOWUP: , Followup has already been scheduled with Dr. Y in February and they will continue to keep that date for followup.",Neurology

The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patient have less pain and improved function, all questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interfere with normal daily activity.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was given 1 g of Ancef IV for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure.  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was achieved followed by a local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE:, Closing wedge osteotomy, fifth metatarsal with internal screw fixation, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision was made extending from the base of the proximal phalanx fifth digit to a point 1.5 cm from the base of the fifth metatarsal.  Care was taken to identify and retract all vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  The extensor tendon was identified and retracted medially.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue down to the periosteal layer.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint revealed articular cartilage to be perverse and hypertrophic changes to the lateral and dorsolateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal head.  An oscillating saw was utilized to carefully resect the hypertrophic portion of the fifth metatarsal head to a more normal configuration.  The both edges were rasped smooth.,Attention was then focused on the fifth metatarsal.  The periosteal layer proximal to the fifth metatarsal head was underscored, free from its underlying attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface.  An excess guide position perpendicular to the weightbearing surface was placed to define apex of the osteotomy.,Using an oscillating saw, a vertically placed, wedge-shaped oblique ostomy was made with the apex being proximal, lateral, and the base medial and distal.  Generous amounts of lateral cortex were preserved for the lateral hinge.  The wedge was removed from the surgical field.  The fifth metatarsal was placed in the appropriate position and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then countersunk and a 3-0 x 40 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.  Good purchase was noted at the osteotomy site.  Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the fourth intermetatarsal angle with the fifth metatarsal in good alignment and position.  The surgical site was flushed with copious amounts of normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layers were closed with running sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin edges were closed with 4-0 nylon in a running interrupted fashion.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, confirming bandages, and ACE wrap to provide mild compression was applied.

The piriformis fossa was identified, and the piriformis fossa tendon was elevated with the use of a Cobb.  It was detached from the piriformis fossa and tagged with 2-0 Vicryl.  Access to the capsule was performed.  The capsule was excised from the posterior and superior aspects.  It was released also in the front with the use of a Mayo scissors.  The hip was then dislocated.  With the use of an oscillating saw, the femoral neck cut was performed.  The acetabulum was then visualized and debrided from soft tissues and osteophytes.  Reaming was initiated and completed for a 48 mm diameter cap without complications.  The trial component was put in place and was found to be stable in an anatomic position.  The actual component was then impacted in the acetabulum.  A 10-degree lip polyethylene was also placed in the acetabular cap.  Our attention was then focused to the femur.  With the use of a cookie cutter, the femoral canal was accessed.  The broaching process was initiated for No.4 trial component.  Trialing of the hip with the hip flexed at 90 degrees and internally rotated to 30 degrees did not demonstrate any obvious instability or dislocation.  In addition, in full extension and external rotation, there was no dislocation.  The actual component was inserted in place and hemostasis was achieved again.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The wound was then closed in layers.  Before performing that the medium-sized Hemovac drain was placed in the wound.  The tensor fascia lata was closed with 0 PDS and the wound was closed with 2-0 Monocryl.  Staples were used for the skin.  The patient recovered from anesthesia without complications.,EBL: , 50 mL.,IV FLUIDS: , 2 liters.,DRAINS: , One medium-sized Hemovac.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.

Osteosynthesis of acetabular fracture on the left, complex variety.,2.  Total hip replacement.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient in the left side up lateral position under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's left lower extremity and buttock area were prepped with iodine and alcohol in the usual fashion, draped with sterile towels and drapes so as to create a sterile field.  Kocher Langenbeck variety incision was utilized and carried down through the fascia lata with the split fibers of the gluteus maximus in line.  The femoral insertion of gluteus maximus was tenotomized close to its femoral insertion.  The piriformis and obturator internus tendons and adjacent gemelli were tenotomized close to their femoral insertion, tagged, and retractor was placed in the lesser notch as well as a malleable retractor in the greater notch enabling the exposure of the posterior column.  The major transverse fracture was freed of infolded soft tissue, clotted blood, and lavaged copiously with sterile saline solution and then reduced anatomically with the aid of bone hook in the notch and provisionally stabilized utilizing a tenaculum clamp and definitively stabilized utilizing a 7-hole 3.5 mm reconstruction plate with the montage including two interfragmentary screws.  It should be mentioned that prior to reduction and stabilization of the acetabular fracture its femoral head component was removed from the joint enabling direct visualization of the articular surface.  Once a stable fixation of the reduced fracture of the acetabulum was accomplished, it should be mentioned that in the process of doing this, the posterior wall fragment was hinged on its soft tissue attachments and a capsulotomy was made in the capsule in line with the rent at the level of the posterior wall.  Once this was accomplished, the procedure was turned over to Dr. X and his team, who proceeded with placement of cup and femoral components as well and cup was preceded by placement of a trabecular metal tray for the cup with screw fixation of same.  This will be dictated in separate note.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sciatic nerve was well protected and directly visualized to the level of the notch.",Surgery

2314,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Erythema of the right knee and leg, possible septic knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Erythema of the right knee superficial and leg, right septic knee ruled out.,INDICATIONS: , Mr. ABC is a 52-year-old male who has had approximately eight days of erythema over his knee.  He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint.  He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success.  He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point.  He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful.  Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time.  Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee.  After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella.  The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint.  Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,DISPOSITION: , Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint.  We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain.  We will follow these results.  After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics.",Orthopedic
363,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot.,ANESTHESIA:,  IV sedation with local.,HISTORY: , This patient is a 55-year-old female who presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion.  The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes.  The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time.  Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously.  The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.  Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then lowered to the operating field.,A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery.  A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially.  Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well.  Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully.  The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule.  The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree.  Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx.  Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition.  Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head.  In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected.  Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well.  Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head.  Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal.  A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well.  Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral.  After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made.  This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone.  Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially.  The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone.  Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction.  Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit.  The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex.  Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved.  Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked.  Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap.  Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened.  Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved.  Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite.  Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted.  Based on this, a lateral release was performed.  The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace.  The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected.  Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament.  Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment.  The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline.  After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers.  The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture.  Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing.  The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg.  The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day.  The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling.  The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation.  The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office.  The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that.  The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise.  X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this.",Surgery
3885,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 67-year-old female, was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy to improve her functional communication skills and swallowing function and safety.  At the onset of therapy, on 03/26/08, the patient was NPO with a G-tube and the initial speech and language evaluation revealed global aphasia with an aphasia quotient of 3.6/100 based on the Western Aphasia Battery.  Since the initial evaluation, the patient has attended 60 outpatient speech therapy sessions, which have focussed on her receptive communication, expressive language, multimodality communication skills, and swallowing function and safety.,SHORT-TERM GOALS:,1.  The patient met 3 out of 4 original short-term therapy goals, which were to complete a modified barium swallow study, which she did do and which revealed no aspiration.  At this time, the patient is eating and drinking and taking all medications by mouth; however, her G-tube is still present.  The patient was instructed to talk to the primary care physician about removal of her feeding tube.,2.  The patient will increase accuracy of yes-no responses to greater than 80% accuracy.  She did accomplish this goal.  The patient is also able to identify named objects with greater than 80% accuracy.,ADDITIONAL GOALS: , Following the completion of these goals, additional goals were established.  Based on reevaluation, the patient met 2 out of these 3 initial goals and she is currently able to read and understand simple sentences with greater than 90% accuracy independently and she is able to write 10 words related to basic wants and needs with greater than 80% accuracy independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty stating verbally, yes or no, to questions as well as accurately using head gestures and to respond to yes-no questions.  The patient continues to have marked difficulty with her expressive language abilities.  She is able to write simple words to help express her basic wants and needs.  She has made great strides; however, with her receptive communication, she is able to read words as well as short phrases and able to point to named objects and answer simple-to-moderate complex yes-no questions.  A reevaluation completed on 12/01/08, revealed an aphasia quotient of 26.4.  Once again, she made significant improvement and comprehension, but continues to have unintelligible speech.  An alternative communication device was discussed with the patient and her husband, but at this time, the patient does not want to utilize a communication device.  If, in the future, the patient continues to struggle with her expressive communication, an alternative augmented communication device would be a benefit to her.  Please reconsult at that time if and when the patient is ready to use a speech generating device.  The patient is discharged from my services at this time due to a plateau in her progress.  Numerous home activities were recommended to allow her to continue to make progress at home.",Discharge Summary

He has underlying sinus bradycardia.  Therefore, will likely be pacing much of the time and would benefit from a biventricular pacing device.,RISKS AND BENEFITS:,  Risks, benefits, and alternatives to implantation of biventricular AICD and defibrillation threshold testing were discussed with the patient.  Risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  After achieving appropriate anesthesia, a percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was performed under fluoroscopy with two separate sticks.  Guidewires were advanced down into the left axillary vein.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the more lateral of the guidewires, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator was removed and another wire was advanced down into the sheath.  The sheath was then backed up over the top of the two wires.  One wire was pinned to the drape and using the alternate wire, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced down into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A defibrillation lead was then advanced down into the atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical septal location.  The active fix screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily and there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  Using the wire that had been pinned to the drape, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over this wire into the axillary vein.  The wire and dilator were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down to the right atrium and the peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was parked until a later time.  Using the separate access point, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A curved outer sheath catheter as well as an inner catheter were advanced down into the area of the coronary sinus.  The coronary sinus was cannulated.  Inner catheter was removed and a balloon-tipped catheter was advanced into the coronary sinus.  A coronary sinus venogram was then performed.  It was noted that the most suitable location for lead placement was the middle cardiac vein.  This was cannulated and a passive lead was advanced over a Whisper EDS wire into a distal position.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily.  There was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The outer sheath was peeled away.  The 9 French sheath was then peeled away.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  At this point, the atrial lead was then positioned in the right atrial appendage using a preformed J-curved stylet.  The lead body was turned several times and the lead was affixed to the tissue.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  A suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  Pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.  The leads were carefully wrapped behind the pulse generator and the entire system was placed in the pocket.  The pocket was then closed with 2-0, 3-0, and 4-0 Vicryl using a running mattress stitch.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure and no acute complications were noted.,The patient was sedated further and shock on T was performed on two separate occasions.

Her cervix did make some cervical chains.  She did progress to 75% and -2, however, there was a raised lobular area palpated on the fetal head.  However, on exam unable to delineate the facial structures, but definite fetal malpresentation.  The fetal heart tones did start and it continued to have variable decelerations with contractions overall are reassuring.  The contraction pattern was inadequate.  It was discussed with the patient's family that in light of the physical exam and with the fetal malpresentation that a cesarean section will be recommended.  All the questions were answered.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with a leftward tilt.  Prior to this, the spinal anesthesia was administered.  The patient was then prepped and draped.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was then grasped with Ochsners, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The superior portion and inferior portion of the rectus fascia was identified, tented up and the underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected up bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was then identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then gently stretched.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with an Allis and the bladder flap was created bluntly as well as using Metzenbaum scissors.  The uterus was entered with the second scalpel and large transverse incision.  This was then extended in upward and lateral fashion bluntly.  The infant was then delivered atraumatically.  The nose and mouth were suctioned.  The cord was then clamped and cut.  The infant was handed off to the awaiting pediatrician.  The placenta was then manually extracted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then repaired using #0 chromic in a running fashion marking a U stitch.  A second layer of the same suture was used in an imbricating fashion to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was then returned to the anatomical position.  The abdomen and the gutters were cleared of all clots.  Again, the incision was found to be hemostatic.  The rectus muscle was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl in a single interrupted stitch.  The rectus fascia was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion locking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  This was palpated and the patient was found to be without defect and intact.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She will be followed up as an inpatient with Dr. X.",Surgery

The patient was explained the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained.,GROSS FINDINGS: , Upon dissection of the left axillary mass, the mass was removed in toto and noted to have a cavity within it consistent with an abscess.,No loose structures were identified and sent for frozen section, which upon intraoperative consultation with Pathology Department revealed no obvious evidence of lymphoma, however, the confirmed pathology report is pending at this time.  The right axillary mass was excised without difficulty without requiring full axillary dissection.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in supine position after appropriate anesthesia was obtained and a sterile prep and drape complete.  A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision about the mass itself extending this incision further to aid in the mobilization of the mass.  Sharp dissection was utilized with Metzenbaum scissors about the mass to maintain the injury to the skin structure and upon showing out the mass, Bovie electrocautery was utilized adjacent to the wall structure to maintain hemostasis.  Identification of the axillary anatomy was made and care was made to avoid injury to nerve, vessel or musculature.  Once this mass was removed in toto, lymph node structures were as well delivered with this mass and sent to frozen section as well the specimen was sent to gram stain and culture.  Upon revaluation of the incisional site, it was noted to be hemostatic.  Warm lap sponge was then left in place at this site.  Next, attention was turned to the right axilla where a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a 4 cm incision about the mass including the cutaneous structures involved with the erythematous reaction.  This was as well removed in toto and sent to Pathology for gram stain and culture as well as pathologic evaluation.  This site was then made hemostatic as well with the aid of Bovie electrocautery and approximation of the deep dermal tissues after irrigation with warm saline was then done with #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by #4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Attention was returned back left axilla, which upon re-exploration was noted to be hemostatic and a #7 mm JP was then introduced making a skin stab inferior to the incision and bringing the end of the drain through this incision.  This was placed within the incision site, ________ drainage of the axillary potential space.  Approximation of the deep dermal tissues were then done with #3-0 Vicryl in an interrupted technique followed by #4-0 Vicryl with running subcuticular technique.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  JP bulb was then placed to suction and sterile dressings were applied to both axilla.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a stable condition.  He will be discharged to home upon ability of the patient to have pain tolerance with Vicodin 1-2 as needed every six hours for pain and continue on Keflex antibiotics until gram stain culture proves otherwise.",Endocrinology

He has also noted to have cord signal at the C4-C5 level secondary to a very large disc herniation that came behind the body at C5 as well and as well as a large disc herniation at C5-C6.  Risks and benefits of the surgery including bleeding, infection, neurologic deficit, nonunion, progressive spondylosis, and lack of improvement were all discussed.  He understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  The patient was placed in the supine position with all pressure points noted and well padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid.  Blunt dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and trachea and esophagus moved medially.  We then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found to be at C5-C6.  Distracting pins were placed in the body of C4 and in to the body of C6.  The disc was then completely removed at C4-C5.  There was very significant compression of the cord.  This was carefully removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord.  This was very severe and multiple free fragments were noted.  This was taken down to the level of ligamentum.  Both foramen were then also opened.  Other free fragments were also found behind the body of C5, part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all of these were removed.  The exact same procedure was done at C5-C6; however, if there were again free fragments noted, there was less not as severe compression at the C4-C5 area.  Again part of the body at C5 was removed to make sure that there was no additional constriction.  Both nerve roots were then widely decompressed.  Machine bone allograft was placed into the C4-C5 as well as C5-C6 and then a Zephyr plate was placed in the body of C4 and to the body of C6 with a metal pin placed into the body at C5.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  Fluoroscopy showed good placement and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  Fascia was closed with 3-0 Vicryl, subcuticular 3-0 Dermabond for skin.

2940,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma.  The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins.  The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.,Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use.  The bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  There was extensively aerated temporal bone.  At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  The eighth nerve was identified and transected.  Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  It was released from the brainstem ventrally.  The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal.  The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition.  All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,100 mL.",Neurology

The patient has a long history of crippling severe rheumatoid arthritis.  She has pain with shoe gear and pain with every step.  She has tried multiple conservative measures under Dr. X's supervision consisting of wide shoe's and accommodative padding all which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical reconstruction/correction.  The consent is available on the chart for review and the risks versus benefits of this procedure have been discussed with patient in detail by Dr. X.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine were instilled into the right foot using a standard ankle block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 230 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field.  The sterile stockinette was reflected and attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The joint was found to be severely contracted with lateral deviation of the hallux with a slightly overlapping contracted second toe.  In addition, the range of motion was less than 5 degrees of the first ray.  There was medial pinch callus and callus on the plantar right second metatarsal.  Using a #10 blade, a linear incision over the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then created approximately 4 cm in length.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue all which was found to be very thin taking care to protect the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Any small vein traversing the operative site were clamped with hemostat and ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined with sharp dissection.  The joint capsule was then visualized.  Two apparent soft tissue masses probably consistent with rheumatoid nodules were found at the distal medial aspect of the first metatarsal capsule.  A dorsal linear incision to the capsular tissue down to bone was performed with a #15 blade.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were elevated sharply off the metatarsal head and the base of proximal  phalanx.,A large amount of hypertrophic synovium was encountered over the metatarsophalangeal joint.  In addition, multiple hypertrophic exostosis were found dorsally, medially, and laterally over the metatarsal.  Upon entering the joint, the base of the proximal phalanx was grossly deformed and the medial and lateral aspect were widely flared and encompassing the metatarsal head.  A sagittal saw was used to carefully remove the base of the proximal phalanx just distal to the metaphyseal flare.  Next, the bone was passed out as specimen.  The head of the metatarsal had evidence of erosion and eburnation.  The tibial sesamoid was practically absent, but was found to be a conglomeration of hypertrophic synovium and poorly differentiated appearing exostosis and bony tissue.  This was hindering the range of motion of the joint and was removed.  The fibular sesamoid was in the interspace.  A lateral release was performed in addition.  Next, the McGlamry elevators were inserted into the first metatarsal head and all of the plantar adhesions were freed.  The metatarsal head was remodeled with a sagittal saw and all of the medial eminence the dorsal and lateral hypertropic bone was removed and the metatarsal head was shaped into more acceptable contoured structure.  Next, the Biopro sizer was used and it was found that a median large implant would be the best fit for this patient's joint.  A small drill hole was made in the central aspect at the base of the proximal phalanx.  The trial sizer median large was placed in the joint and an excellent fit and increased range of motion was observed.,Next, the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A median large porous Biopro implant was inserted using the standard technique and was tapped with the mallet into position.  It had an excellent fit and the range of motion again was markedly increased from the preoperative level.  Next, the wound was again flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The flexor tendon was inspected and was found to be intact plantarly.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion.  A medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature.  There was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with #15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.,Next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a #15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint.  The tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  The bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded.  The base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal-appearing cartilage.  A sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  Next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft.  The toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position.  An extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated.  The same suture material was used and the same 0.045 Kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation.,Attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated.  The same suture material was used.  However, a 0.062 Kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0.045 Kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight.  Next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a #10 blade approximately 2 cm in length.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  The toe assumed to more rectus position.  The reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces.  The joint was again flushed with saline.  Next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  The skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique.,Next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin.  A #10 blade was used to make a 2.5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively.  Next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  Hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly.  A sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  A bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures.  The skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The ______ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with #5-0 Monocryl.  Attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated.  Therefore, a #15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The tendon was transected.  Next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed.  Next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position.  One #4-0 nylon suture was placed in the skin.,Mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds.  Betadine-soaked Owen silk was applied to all wounds.  Betadine-soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  All the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped.  A standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  She was given prescription for Tylenol #3, #40 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c.  She is to continue her rheumatoid arthritis drugs preoperatively prescribed by the rheumatologist.,She is to follow up with Dr. X in the office.

2901,"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few-month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves.  Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago.  This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time.  She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms.  She is almost asymptomatic at present.  She dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs.  She has had no associated weakness.,On brief examination, straight leg raising is normal.

Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil.  I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return.  With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes.  However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following:  Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer.",Neurology

She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  TED hose and SCDs were placed.  After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin.  These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.,After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin.  They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement.  Undermining was performed.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene.  Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made.  Dissection was carried down to the capsule.  It was extremely calcified.  Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed.  The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone.  Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured.  No marking as to the size of the implant was found.,Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold.

4974,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina.  In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her.  I advised her to call 911, which she did.  While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain.  By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: , The patient has been having arm pain for several months.  She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia.  I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker.  However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room.  On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80%  mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area.  The decision was made to transfer  her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel.  She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08.  She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild.  Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin.  This is her usual angina.  She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.,MEDICATIONS:,1.

SHE DENIES ANY SHRIMP OR SEA FOOD ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Her father died of an MI in his 50s and a brother had his first MI and bypass surgery at 54.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, no use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08.  No morning headaches or fatigue.  No psychiatric diagnosis.  No psoriasis, no lupus.

She has moist mucosal membranes.,NECK:  Veins are not distended.  There are no carotid bruits.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion without wheezes.,HEART:  S1 and S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  PMI nondisplaced.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and nondistended.  Bowel sounds present.,EXTREMITIES:  Without significant clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Pulses grossly intact.  Bilateral groins are inspected, status post as the right femoral artery was used for access for the diagnostic cardiac catheterization here and left femoral artery used for PCI and there is no evidence of hematoma or bruit and intact distal pulses.,LABORATORY DATA: , EKG reviewed which shows sinus bradycardia at the rate of 51 beats per minute and no acute disease.,Sodium 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 105, and bicarbonate 27.

INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  ,The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery.  In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy.  We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already.  Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc.  I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion.  I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect.  My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function.  She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.,Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.  All this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement.  The patient desires full resuscitation status.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
3204,"3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION,This patient is undergoing 3-dimensionally planned radiation therapy in order to adequately target structures at risk while diminishing the degree of exposure to uninvolved adjacent normal structures.  This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects.  With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived.  Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician.  Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the  immobilization device.,The patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are performed through the targeted area.  The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images.  The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures.  This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features.  Appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures.,Once appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised.  If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated.,In view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470.",Hematology - Oncology

She had a history of open heart surgery at 11 months' of age.  She presented with severe anterior caries with most likely dental extractions needed.  Due to her young age, I felt that she would be best served in the safety of the hospital operating room.  After consultation with the mother, she agreed to have her treated in the safety of the hospital operating room at Children's Hospital.,OPERATIVE PREPARATION:  ,This child was brought to Hospital Day Surgery and is accompanied by her mother.  There I met with them and discussed the needs of the child, types of restorations to be performed, the risks and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all their questions and concerns were addressed, I gave the informed consent to proceed with the treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  Once she was cleared by Anesthesia and the child was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with a nasal endotracheal tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and the eyes were taped shut for protection.  An angiocatheter was placed in the left hand and an IV was started.  The head and neck were draped with sterile towels, and the body was covered with a lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond the tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative clinical photographs were taken.  Two posterior bitewing radiographs and two anterior periapical films were taken in the operating room with digital radiography.  After the radiographs were taken, the lead shield was removed.  Prophylaxis was then performed using prophy cup and fluoridated prophy paste.  The teeth were then rinsed well and the patient's oral cavity was suctioned clean.  Clinical and radiographic examinations followed and areas of decay were noted.  During the restorative phase, these areas of decay were entered into and removed.  Entry was made to the level of the dental-enamel junction and beyond as necessary to remove it.  Final caries was removed and was confirmed upon reaching hard, firm sounding dentin.  Teeth restored with amalgam had a dentin tubular seal placed prior to amalgam placement.  Non-restorable primary teeth would be extracted.,Upon conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were then taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction with visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.,At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS:  ,This young patient presented with mild generalized marginal gingivitis secondary to light generalized plaque accumulation and fair oral hygiene.  All primary teeth were present.  Dental caries were present on the following teeth:  Tooth D, E, F, and G caries on all surfaces; teeth J, lingual caries.  The remainder of her teeth and soft tissues were within normal limits.  The following restorations and procedures were performed:  Tooth D, E, F, and G were extracted and four sutures were placed one at each extraction site and tooth J lingual amalgam.,CONCLUSION:  ,The mother was informed of the completion of the procedure.  She was given a synopsis of the treatment provided as well as written and verbal instructions for postoperative care.

General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation.  The Right groin and abdomen were prepped and draped in the standard sterile surgical fashion.  An incision was made approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle and in a skin crease.  Dissection was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Scarpa's fascia was divided, and the external ring was located.  The external oblique was divided from the external ring up towards the anterior superior iliac spine.  The cord structures were then encircled.  Careful inspection of the cord structures did not reveal any indirect sac along the cord structures.  I did, however, feel a direct sac with a direct defect.  I opened the floor of the inguinal canal and dissected out the preperitoneal space at the direct sac and cut out the direct sac.  Once I cleared out the preperitoneal space, I placed a PHS mesh system with a posterior mesh into the preperitoneal space, and I made sure that it laid flat along Cooper's ligament and covered the myopectineal orifice.  I then tucked the extended portion of the anterior mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, and I then tacked the medial portion of the mesh to the pubic tubercle with a 0 Ethibond suture.  I tacked the superior portion of the mesh to the internal oblique and the inferior portion of the mesh to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament.  I cut a hole in the mesh in order to incorporate the cord structures and recreated the internal ring, making sure that it was not too tight so that it did not strangulate the cord structures.  I then closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl.  I closed the Scarpa's with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and I closed the skin with a running Monocril.  Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and without any complications.",Urology

Although, the patient is right-handed, preoperative vein mapping demonstrated much better vein in the right arm.  Hence, a right brachiocephalic fistula is being planned.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS,The right cephalic vein at the elbow is chosen to be suitable.  It is slightly sporadic, but of an adequate size.  An end-to-side right brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula was created.  At completion, there was a great thrill.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The patient received a regional nerve block.  The patient also received intravenous sedation.  The right arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,We made a small transverse incision in the right cubital fossa.  The cephalic vein was identified and mobilized.  The fascia was incised, and the brachial artery was also identified and mobilized.  The brachial artery was free off significant disease.  A good pulse was noted.  The cephalic vein was mobilized proximally and distally.  The brachial artery was mobilized proximally and distally.  We did not give heparin.  The brachial artery was then clamped proximally and distally.  The cephalic vein was also clamped proximally and distally.  Longitudinal arteriotomy was made in brachial artery, and a longitudinal venotomy was made in the cephalic vein.  We then sewn the vein to the artery in a side-to-side fashion using a running 7-0 Prolene suture.,Just prior to completion of the anastomosis, it was flushed, and the anastomosis was then completed.  A great thrill was noted.  We then ligated the cephalic vein beyond the arteriovenous anastomosis and divided it.  This surrounded the anastomosis as an end-to-side functionally.  A great thrill remained in the fistula.  Hemostasis was secured.  We then closed the wound using interrupted PDS sutures for the fascia and a running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture for the skin.  Sterile dry dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no operative complications.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.

3455,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check.  The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed.  On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound.  She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom.  She is having good ostomy output.  She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy.  She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work.  She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain.  She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds.  This is a pleasant female in no acute distress.  The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.  There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.",Gastroenterology

She has been dealing with these symptoms for greater than three months.  She comes to my office with severe pain, left my office and reported to the Emergency Room where she was admitted for pain control one day before surgery.  I have discussed the MRI findings with the patient and the potential risks and complications.  She was scheduled to go to surgery through my office, but because of her severe symptoms, she was unable to keep that appointment and reported right to the Emergency Room.  We discussed the diagnosis and the operative procedure in detail.  I have reviewed the potential risks and complications and she had agreed to proceed with the surgery.  Due to the patient's weight which exceeds 340 lb, there was some concern about her operative table being able to support her weight and also my standard microlumbar discectomy incision is not ________ in this situation just because of the enormous size of the patient's back and abdomen and I have discussed this with her.  She is aware that she will have a much larger incision than what is standard and has agreed to accept this.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital.  While in the hospital gurney, Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic, endotracheal intubation was followed.  A Jackson table was prepared for the patient and was reinforced replacing struts under table to prevent the table from collapsing.  The table reportedly does have a limit of 500 lb, but the table has never been stressed above 275 lb.  Once the table was reinforced, the patient was carefully rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table with the bony prominences being well padded.  A marker was placed in from the back at this time and an x-ray was obtained for incision localization.  The back is now prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made over the L5-S1 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissue sharply with a #10 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The lumbar dorsal fascia was then encountered and incised to the left of midline.  In the subperiosteal fashion, the musculature was elevated off the lamina at L5 and S1 after facet joint, but not disturbing the capsule.  A second marker was now placed and an intraoperative x-ray confirms our location at the L5-S1 disc space.  The microscope was brought into the field at this point and the remainder of the procedure done with microscopic visualization and illumination.  A high speed drill was used to perform a laminotomy by removing small portion of the superior edge of the S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina.  Ligaments and fragments were encountered and removed at this time.  The epidural space was now encountered.  The S1 nerve root was now visualized and found to be displaced dorsally as a result of a large disc herniation while the nerve was carefully protected with a Penfield.  A small stab incision was made into the disc fragment and probably a large portion of disc extrudes from the opening.  This disc fragment was removed and the nerve root was much more supple, it was carefully retracted.  The nerve root was now retracted and using a series of downgoing curettes, additional disc material was removed from around the disc space and from behind the body of S1 and L5.  At this point, all disc fragments were removed from the epidural space.  Murphy ball was passed anterior to the thecal sac in the epidural space and there was no additional compression that I can identify.  The disc space was now encountered and loose disc fragments were removed from within the disc space.  The disc space was then irrigated.  The nerve root was then reassessed and found to be quite supple.  At this point, the Murphy ball was passed into the foramen of L5 and this was patent and also into the foramen of S1 by passing ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there were no obstructions in the passage of the device.  At this point, the wound was irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  Gelfoam was used to cover the epidural space.  The retractors were removed at this point.  The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips for curved incision.  The patient was transferred to the hospital gurney in supine position and extubated by Anesthesia, subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.",Orthopedic

A gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in all four quadrants, a total of 6.8 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and 3.6 mL of Marcaine 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The area in the left vestibular area adjacent to the teeth #18 and #19 was aspirated with 5 cc syringe with an 18-guage needle and approximately 1 mL of purulent material was aspirated.  This was placed on the culture medium in the aerobic and anaerobic culture tubes and the tubes were then sent to the lab.  An incision was then made in the left mandibular vestibule adjacent to teeth #18 and #19.  The area was bluntly dissected with a curved hemostat and a small amount of approximately 3 mL of purulent material was drained.  Penrose drain was then placed using a curved hemostat.  The drain was secured with 3-0 silk suture.  The extraction of the teeth was then begun on the left side removing teeth #12, #15, #18 and #19 with forceps extraction, then moving to the right side teeth #2, #5, and #31 were removed with forceps extraction uneventfully.  After completion of the procedure, the throat pack was removed, the pharynx was suctioned.

The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor.  Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor.  The bone flap was elevated.  The ultrasound was then used.  The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure.  We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation.  We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile.  We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy.  Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely.  We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus.  After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used.  We obtained access to the tumor.  We biopsied this and submitted it.  This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer.,Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total.  After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery.  The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates.  The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle.  This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage.  The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap.  The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures.  The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp.  The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation.,Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy.  The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa.",Surgery

I obtained her history from company medical records and performed an examination.  She is a 38-year-old laborer who states that she was injured on April 26, 2006, which according to the FROI (the injury occurred over a period of time from performing normal job processes such as putting bumpers on cars, gas caps and doors on cars).  She denies having any symptoms prior to the accident April 26, 2006.  She is right handed.  She used a tennis elbow brace, hand exercises, physical therapy, and Vicodin.  She received treatment from Dr. X and also Dr. Y,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:,  June 27, 2006, EMG and nerve conduction velocity right upper extremity showed a moderate right carpal tunnel syndrome.  No evidence of a right cervical radiculopathy or ulnar neuropathy at the wrist or elbow.  January 29, 2007, EMG right upper extremity was normal and there was a normal nerve conduction velocity.  At the time of the examination, she complained of a constant pain in the olecranon and distal triceps with tingling in the right long, ring and small fingers, and night pain.  The pain was accentuated by gripping or opening the jar.  She is taking four Aleve a day and currently does not have any other treatment.,RECORDS REVIEWED: , Injury and illness incident report, US Healthworks records; Z physician review; Y office notes; X office notes who noted that on examination of the right elbow that the ulnar nerve subluxed with flexion and extension of the elbow.,EXAMINATION: , Examination of her right elbow revealed no measurable atrophy of the upper arm.  She was markedly tender over the medial epicondyle, but also the olecranon and distal process and she was exquisitely tender over the ulnar nerve.  I did not detect subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension.  With this, she was extremely tender in this area.  There is no instability of the elbow.  Range of motion was 0 to 145 degrees, flexion 90 degrees of pronation and supination.  The elbow flexion test was positive.  There is normal motor power in the elbow and also on the right hand, specifically in the ulnar intrinsics.  There was diminished sensation on the right ring and small fingers, specifically the ulnar side of the ring finger of the entire small finger.  There was no wasting of the intrinsics.  No clawing of the hand.  Examination of the right wrist revealed extension 45 degrees, flexion 45 degrees, radial deviation 15 degrees, and ulnar deviation 35 degrees.  She was tender over the dorsum of the hand over the ulnar head and the volar aspect of the wrist.  Wrist flexion causes paresthesias on the right ring and small fingers.  Grasp was weak.  There was no sign of causalgia, but no measurable atrophy of the forearm.  No reflex changes.,QUESTION:,  Ms. Xxxxx has filed an application of additional allowance of right cubital tunnel syndrome.  Based on the current objective findings, mechanism of injury, medical records or diagnostic studies, does the medical evidence support the existence of the requested condition?,ANSWER:,  Yes.  She has a positive elbow flexion test and she is markedly tender over the ulnar nerve at the elbow and also has diminished sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution, specifically in the entire right small finger and the ulnar half of the ring finger.  I did not find the subluxation of the ulnar nerve with flexion and extension with Dr. X did previously find on his examination.,QUESTION: , If you find these conditions exist, are they a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury?,ANSWER: , Yes.  Repeated flexion and extension would irritate the ulnar nerve particularly if it was subluxing which it could very well have which Dr. X objectively identified on his examination.  Therefore, I believe it is a direct and proximate result of April 26, 2006, injury.,QUESTION: , Do you find that Ms. Xxxxx's injury or disability is caused by natural deterioration of tissue, organ or part of the body?,ANSWER: , No.,QUESTION:,  In addition, if you find that the condition exists, are there non-occupational activities or intervening injuries that could have contributed to Ms. Xxxxx's condition?,ANSWER: , It is possible that direct injury to the ulnar nerve at the elbow could cause this syndrome; however, there is no history of this and the records do not indicate an injury of this type.,QUESTION: ,",IME-QME-Work Comp etc.

Positive for allodynia, pain, mottled appearance, skin changes upper extremities as well as swelling.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , Patient is admitted to the Operating Room.  Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  ,Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.",Surgery

Left superficial femoral artery subtotal stenosis.,2.  Arterial insufficiency, left lower extremity.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,1.  Left lower extremity angiogram.,2.  Left superficial femoral artery laser atherectomy.,3.  Left superficial femoral artery percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty.  ,4.  Left external iliac artery angioplasty.,5.  Left external iliac artery stent placement.,6.  Completion angiogram.,FINDINGS:  ,This patient was brought to the OR with a non-severe stenosis of the proximal left superficial femoral artery in the upper one-third of his thigh.  He is also known to have severe calcific disease involving the entire left external iliac system as well as the common femoral and deep femoral arteries.,Our initial plan today was to perform an atherectomy with angioplasty and stenting of the left superficial femoral artery as necessary.  However, whenever we started the procedure, it became clear that there was a severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery at its takeoff from the left common femoral artery.  The area was severely calcified including the external iliac artery extending up underneath the left inguinal ligament.  Indeed, this ultimately was dissected due to manipulation of sheath catheters and sheath through the area.  Ultimately, this wound up being a much more complex case than initially anticipated.,Because of the above, we ultimately performed a laser atherectomy of the left superficial femoral artery, which then had to be angioplastied to obtain a satisfactory result.  The completion angiogram showed that there was a dissection of the left external iliac artery, which precluded flow down into the left lower extremity.  We then had to come up and perform angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery as well as aggressively dilating the takeoff of the less superficial femoral artery from the common femoral artery.,The left superficial femoral artery was dilated with a 6-mm balloon.,The left external iliac artery and common femoral arteries were dilated with an 8-mm balloon.,A 2.5-mm ClearPath laser probe was used to initially arthrectomize and debulk the superficial femoral artery starting at its takeoff from the common femoral artery and extending down to the tight stenotic area in the upper one-third of the thigh.  After the laser atherectomy was performed, the area still did not look good and so an angioplasty was then done, which looked good; however, as noted above, after we had dealt with the superficial femoral artery, we then had proximal inflow problems, which had to be dealt by angioplasty and stenting.,The patient had good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally upon completion.,The right common femoral artery was used for access in an up-and-over technique.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.,The right common femoral artery was punctured percutaneously, and a #5-French sheath was initially placed.  We used a pigtail catheter to go up and over the aortic bifurcation and placed a stiff Amplatz guidewire down into the left common femoral artery.  We then heparinized the patient and placed a #7-French Raby sheath over the Amplatz wire.  A selective left lower extremity angiogram was then done with the above-noted findings.,We then used a ClearPath 2.5-mm laser probe to laser the proximal superficial femoral artery.  Because of the findings as noted above, this became more involved than initially hoped for.  Once the laser atherectomy had been completed, the vessel still did not look good, so we used a 6-mm balloon to thoroughly dilate the area.  Once that had been done, it looked good and we performed what we felt would be a completion angiogram only to find out that we had a more proximal problem precluding flow down into the left femoral artery.,Once that was discovered, we then had to proceed with angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery right down to the acetabular level.,Once we had dealt with our run-on problems, we then did another completion angiogram, which showed a good flow through the entire area and down into the left lower extremity.,Following completion of the above, all wires, sheaths, and catheters were removed from the right common femoral artery.  Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and a firm pressure dressing.,The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout.  He had good palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally on completion.  He was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Protamine was given to partially reverse the heparin.",Surgery
3365,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 2-year-old female who comes in for just rechecking her weight, her breathing status, and her diet.  The patient is in foster care, has a long history of the prematurity, born at 22 weeks.  She has chronic lung disease, is on ventilator, but doing sprints, has been doing very well, is up to 4-1/2 hours sprints twice daily and may go up 15 minutes every three days or so; which she has been tolerating fairly well as long as they kind of get her distracted towards the end, otherwise, she does get sort of tachypneic.  She is on 2-1/2 liters of oxygen and does require that.  Her diet has been fluctuating.  They have been trying to figure out what works best with her.  She has been on some Pediasure for the increased calories but that really makes her distended in the abdomen and constipates her.  They have been doing more pureed foods and that seems to loosen her up, so they have been doing more Isomil 24 cal and baby foods and not so much Pediasure.  She was hospitalized a couple of weeks back for the distension she had in the abdomen.  Dr. XYZ has been working with her G-tube, increasing her Mic-key button size, but also doing some silver nitrate applications, and he is going to evaluate her again next week, but they are happy with the way her G-tube site is looking.  She also has been seen Dr. Eisenbaum, just got of new pair of glasses this week and sees him in another couple of weeks for reevaluation.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Flagyl, vitamins, Zyrtec, albuterol, and some Colace.,ALLERGIES TO MEDICINES: , None.,FAMILY SOCIAL HISTORY:,  As mentioned, she is in foster care.  Foster mom is actually going to be out of town for a week the 19th through the 23rd, so she will probably be hospitalized in respite care because there are no other foster care situations that can handle the patient.  Biological Mom and Grandma do visit on Thursdays for about an hour.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  The patient has been eating fairly well, sleeping well, doing well with her sprints.  A little difficulty with her stools hard versus soft as mentioned with the diet situation up in HPI.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  She is 28 pounds 8 ounces today, 33-1/2 inches tall.  She is on 2-1/2 liters, but she is not the vent currently, she is doing her sprints, and her respiratory rate is around 40.,HEENT:  Sclerae and conjunctivae are clear.  TMs are clear.  Nares are patent.  Oropharynx is clear.  Trach site is clear of any signs of infection.,Chest:  Coarse.  She has got little bit of wheezing going on, but she is moving air fairly well.,Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds and soft.  The G-tube site looks fairly clean today and healthy.  No signs of infection.  Her tone is good.  Capillary refill is less than three seconds.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-year-old with chronic lung disease, doing the sprints, some bowel difficulties, also just weight gain issues because of the high-energy expenditure with the sprints that she is doing.,PLAN:,  At this point is to continue with the Isomil and pureed baby foods, a little bit of Pediasure.  They are going to see Dr. XYZ towards the end of this month and follow up with Dr. Eisenbaum.  I would like to see her in approximately six weeks again, but we do need to keep a close check on her weight and call if there are problems beforehand.  She is just doing wonderful progression on her development.  Each time I see her, I am very impressed, that relayed to foster mom.

Interpretation of radiograph.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , Severe and excruciating pain in the lumbar spine and lower extremity.  MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.",Pain Management

4753,"CHART NOTE:,  She is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow.  Dr. XYZ had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath.  Then she had the pulmonary function test and CT scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis, but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see Dr. XYZ Estep.  He had concurred with Dr. XYZ that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both Dr. XYZ and I were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy.  She was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath.  She is very concerned about the findings on her CAT scan and pulmonary function test.  She seemed alarmed to report that Dr. XYZ had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60% of what should be normal.  However, I told her that two years ago Dr. XYZ did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function.  And that really her pulmonary function test, at least compared from two years ago, had not really changed over this period of time.  After discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy, the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years, the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath, which is deconditioning and obesity, she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy.  In fact when I called Dr. XYZ to talk to him about cancelling the procedure, he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed.  I also explained to patient that I did not think Dr. XYZ was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those.  And also I spoke with Dr. XYZ who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate, that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities.,I had a 30-minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.  I also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her CAT scan, x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.  And if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem, she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy.  But she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her.  She understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful.,We are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing.  We will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time.  I told her I would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving.  She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home.  She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren.  She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression.  There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home.  She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister.  She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren.  She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations.  She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it.  When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot.  She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication.  She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly.  She denies visual or migraine symptoms.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia.  She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus.  Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness.  She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago.  The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed.  This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations.  The mesothelioma is in her abdomen.  She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma.  She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma.  Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable.  She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position.  These have all occurred over the past five years.  She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation.  This diagnosis was given in March 2006.,MEDICATIONS:,  Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.,ALLERGIES:, NONE.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for her being without a companion at this point.  She was born in Munich, Germany.  She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time.  She is divorced.  She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM.  She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma.  She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.  She is bilingual speaking, German and English.  She has known English from before her teens.  She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany.  She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them.  She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz.  He has grandchildren.  She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer.  Her mother died in her 80s of ""old age,"" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time.  Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient.  No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg.  She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress.  She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date.  She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in.  She lost three points for recall.  Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember.  Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30.  There were no naming problems or problems with repetition.  There were also no signs of dysarthria.  Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation.  Her extraocular movements were intact.  Her visual fields were full to confrontation.  Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal.  There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation.  Tongue was midline.  Her palate was symmetric.  Her face was symmetric as well.  Strength was approximately 5/5.  She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain.  Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace.  Her plantar reflexes were mute.  Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration.  There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia.  Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.,SUMMARY:,  Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.  We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured.  We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept.  She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept.  The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV.  It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment.  She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept.  She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day.  We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.,",Consult - History and Phy.

3090,"HISTORY OF INJURY AND PRESENT COMPLAINTS: , The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman.  He is complaining chiefly of persistent lower back pain.  He states the pain is of a rather constant nature.  He describes it as a rather constant dull ache, sometimes rather sharp and stabbing in nature, most localized to the right side of his back more so than the left side of his lower back.  He states he has difficulty with prolonged standing or sitting.  He can only stand for about 5-10 minutes, then he has to sit down.  He can only sit for about 15-20 minutes, he has to get up and move about because it exacerbates his back pain.  He has difficulty with bending and stooping maneuvers.  He describes an intermittent radiating pain down his right leg, down from the right gluteal hip area to the back of the thigh to the calf and the foot.  He gets numbness along the lateral aspect of the foot itself.  He also describes chronic pain complaints with associated tension in the back of his neck.  He states the pain is of a constant nature in his neck.  He states he gets pain that radiates into the right shoulder girdle area and the right forearm.  He describes some numbness along the lateral aspect of the right forearm.  He states he has trouble trying to use his arm at or above shoulder height.  He has difficulty pushing, pulling, gripping, and grasping with the right upper extremity.  He describes pain at the anterior aspect of his shoulder, in particular.  He denies any headache complaints.  He is relating his above complaints to two industrial injuries that he sustained while employed with Frito Lay Company as a truck driver or delivery person.  He relates an initial injury that occurred on 06/29/1994, when apparently he was stepping out of the cab of his truck.  He lost his footing and fell.  He reached out to grab the hand railing.  He fell backwards on his back and his right shoulder.  He had immediate onset of shoulder pain, neck pain, and low back pain.  He had pain into his right leg.  He initially came under the care of Dr. H, an occupational physician in Modesto.  Initially, he did not obtain any MRIs or x-rays.  He did undergo some physical therapy and received some medications.  Dr. H referred him to Dr. Q, a chiropractor for three visits, which the patient was not certain was very helpful.  The patient advises he then changed treating physicians to Dr. N, D.C., whom he had seen previously for some back pain complaints back in 1990.  He felt that the chiropractic care was helping his back, neck, and shoulder pain complaints somewhat.  He continues with rather persistent pain in his right shoulder.  He underwent an MRI of the right shoulder performed on 08/16/1994 which revealed prominent impingement with biceps tenosynovitis as well as supraspinatus tendonitis superimposed by a small pinhole tear of the rotator cuff.  The patient was referred to Dr. P, an orthopedic surgeon who suggested some physical therapy for him and some antiinflammatories.  He felt that the patient might require a cortisone injection or possibly a surgical intervention.  The patient also underwent an MRI of the cervical spine on 08/03/1994, which again revealed multilevel degenerative disc disease in his neck.  There is some suggestion of bilateral neuroforaminal encroachment due to degenerative changes and disc bulges, particularly at C5-6 and C6-7 levels.  The patient was also seen by Dr. P, a neurologist for a Neurology consult.  It is unclear to me as to whether or not Dr. P had performed an EMG or nerve conduction studies of his upper or lower extremities.  The patient was off work for approximately six months following his initial injury date that occurred on 06/29/1994.  He returned back to regular duty.  Dr. N declared him permanent and stationary on 04/04/1995.  The patient then had a recurrence or flare-up or possibly new injury, again, particularly to his lower back while working for Frito Lay on 03/29/1997, when he was loading some pallets on the back of a trailer.  At that time, he returned to see Dr. N for chiropractic care, who is his primary treating physician.  Dr. N took him off work again.  He was off work again for approximately another six months, during which time, he was seen by Dr. M, M.D., a neurosurgeon.  He had a new MRI of his lumbar spine performed.  The MRI was performed on 05/20/1997.  It revealed L4-5 disc space narrowing with prominent disc bulge with some mild spinal stenosis.  The radiologist had noted he had a prior disc herniation at this level with some improvement from prior exam.  Dr. M saw him on 09/18/1997 and noted that there was some improvement in his disc herniation at the L4-5 level following a more recent MRI exam of 05/20/1997, from previous MRI exam of 1996 which revealed a rather prominent right-sided L4-5 disc herniation.  Dr. M felt that there was no indication for a lumbar spine surgery, but he mentioned with regards to his cervical spine, he felt that EMG studies of the right upper extremity should be obtained and he may require a repeat MRI of the cervical spine, if the study was positive.  The patient did undergo some nerve conduction studies of his lower extremities with Dr. K, M.D., which suggested a possible abnormal EMG with evidence of possible L5 radiculopathy, both right and left.  Unfortunately, I had no medical reports from Dr. P suggesting that he may have performed nerve conduction studies or EMGs of the upper and lower extremities.  The patient did see Dr. R for a neurosurgical consult.  Dr. R evaluated both his neck and lower back pain complaints on several occasions.  Dr. R suggested that the patient try some cervical epidural steroid injections and lumbar selective nerve root blocks.  The patient underwent these injections with Dr. K.  The patient reported only very slight relief temporarily with regards to his back and leg symptoms following the injections.  It is not clear from the medical record review whether the patient ever had a cervical epidural steroid injection; it appears that he had some selective nerve root blocks performed in the lumbar spine.  Dr. R on 12/15/2004 suggested that the patient had an MRI of the cervical spine revealing a right-sided C5-6 herniated nucleus pulposus which would explain his C-6 distribution numbness.  The patient also was noted to have a C4-5 with rather severe degenerative disc disease.  He felt the patient might be a candidate for a two-level ACDF at C4-5 and C5-6.  Dr. R in another report of 08/11/2004 suggested that the patient's MRI of 05/25/2004 of the lumbar spine reveals multilevel degenerative disc disease.  He had an L4-5 slight anterior spondylolisthesis, this may be a transitional vertebrae at the L6 level as well, with lumbarization of S1.  He felt that his examination suggested a possible right S1 radiculopathy with discogenic back pain.  He would suggest right-sided S1 selective nerve root blocks to see if this would be helpful; if not, he might be a candidate for a lumbar spine fusion, possibly a Dynesys or a fusion or some major spine surgery to help resolve his situation., ,The patient relates that he really prefers a more conservative approach of treatment regarding his neck, back, and right shoulder symptoms.  He continued to elect chiropractic care which he has found helpful, but apparently the insurance carrier is no longer authorizing chiropractic care for him.  He is currently taking no medications to manage his pain complaints.  He states regarding his work status, he was off work again for another six months following the 03/29/1997 injury.  He returned back to work and continued to work regular duty up until about a year ago, at which time, he was taken back off work again and placed on TTD status by Dr. N, his primary treating physician.  The patient states he has not been back to work since.  He has since applied for social security disability and now is receiving social security disability benefits.  The patient states he has tried some Myox therapy with Dr. H on 10 sessions, which he found somewhat helpful.  Overall, the patient does not feel that he could return back to his usual and customary work capacity as a delivery driver for Frito Lay.,",IME-QME-Work Comp etc.

2225,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , Resection of infected bone, left hallux, proximal phalanx, and distal phalanx.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/Local.,HISTORY:,  This 77-year-old male presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping himself NPO since mid night for surgery on his infected left hallux.  The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a ""floppy tail"" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound's bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  He is to follow up with Dr. X.  He was given emergency contact numbers.  He is to continue the Vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home.  The patient was discharged in stable condition.",Orthopedic
4263,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago.,He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal.,In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia.  He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias., ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents.  He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.  He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test.  He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing.  He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it.  He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.  He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon., ,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix.  , ,ALLERGIES:,  He has no known drug allergies., ,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives with his wife.  He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering.  He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting.  He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night.  Prior to that, he drank significantly more.  He denies illicit drug use.  He was athletic growing up., ,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His mother died of complications from heart disease.  His father died of heart disease in his 40s.  He has two living brothers.  One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history.  The other is apparently healthy.  He has one healthy child.  His maternal uncles apparently had polio.  When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg.  He is fairly certain that they had polio.  He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has occasional tinnitus.  He has difficulty sleeping.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:, ,Vital Signs:",Consult - History and Phy.

833,"PROCEDURE: , Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage.  Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.,MEDICATIONS:  ,General anesthesia.,INSTRUMENT:,  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FINDINGS: , With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.,The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.,IMPRESSION: , Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.,PLAN:  ,Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.",Surgery

Anterior cervical discectomy of C3-C4.,2.  Removal of herniated disc and osteophytes.,3.  Bilateral C4 nerve root decompression.,4.  Harvesting of bone for autologous vertebral bodies for creation of arthrodesis.,5.  Grafting of fibular allograft bone for creation of arthrodesis.,6.  Creation of arthrodesis via an anterior technique with fibular allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral bodies.,7.  Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has progressive and intractable right C4 radiculopathy with neck and shoulder pain.  Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem.  Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses.  The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck.  Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space.  Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4.  Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed.  Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed.  As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized.,There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs.  A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away.  I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura.,Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen.  The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas.  I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root.  All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura.  However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen.  An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact.,The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed.,Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration.  Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally.  Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well.  An x-ray showed good graft placement.,Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation.  A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws.  Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase.  Next, the locking screws were then applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws.  The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3.  The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs.  Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate.,Attention was turned to closure.  A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar.  The operation was then terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisted of bone and soft tissue as well as C3-C4 disc material.",Surgery

On bimanual exam, the uterus was enlarged, movable, and anteverted.  The intraabdominal findings revealed normal liver margin, kidneys, and stomach upon palpation.  The uterus was found to be normal in size with evidence of endometriosis on the uterus.  The right ovary and fallopian tube were absent.  The left fallopian tube and ovary appeared normal with evidence of a small functional cyst.  There was evidence of left adnexal adhesion to the pelvic side wall which was filmy, unable to be bluntly dissected.  There were multiple interloop bowel adhesions that were filmy in nature noted.,The appendix was absent.  There did appear to be old suture in a portion of the bowel most likely from a prior procedure.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 45-year-old African-American gravida7, para3-0-0-3, who is here for definitive treatment of chronic pelvic pain with a history of endometriosis.  She did have a laparoscopic ablation of endometriosis on a laparoscopy and also has a history of right salpingo-oophorectomy.  She has tried Lupron and did stop secondary to the side effects.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the Operating Suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and placed in the dorsal supine position.  An indwelling Foley catheter was placed.  With the skin knife, an incision was made removing the old cicatrix.  A Bovie was used to carry the tissue through to the underlying layer of the fascia which was incised in the midline and extended with the Bovie.  The rectus muscle was then sharply and bluntly dissected off the superior aspect of the rectus fascia in the superior as well as the inferior aspect using the Bovie.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline using a hemostat and the peritoneum was entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with Metzenbaum scissors with careful visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the intraabdominal cavity was manually explored and the above findings were noted.  A Lahey clamp was then placed on the fundus of the uterus and the uterus was brought to the surgical field.  The bowel was then packed with moist laparotomy sponges.  Prior to this, the filmy adhesions leftover were taken down.  At this point, the left round ligament was identified, grasped with two hemostats, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the broad ligament was dissected down and the lost portion of the bladder flap was created.  The posterior aspect of the peritoneum was also dissected.  At this point, the infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated and three tie of #0 Vicryl was used to isolate the pedicle.  Two hemostats were then placed across the pedicle and this was transected with the scalpel.  This was then suture ligated in Heaney fashion.  The right round ligament was then identified and in the similar fashion, two hemostats were placed across the round ligament and using the Mayo scissors the round ligament was transected and dissected down the broad ligament to create the bladder flap anteriorly as well as dissect the posterior peritoneum and isolate the round ligament.  This was then ligated with three tie of #0 Vicryl.  Also incorporated in this was the remnant from the previous right salpingo-oophorectomy.  At this point, the bladder flap was further created with sharp dissection as well as the moist Ray-Tech to push the bladder down off the anterior portion of the cervix.,The left uterine artery was then skeletonized and a straight Heaney was placed.  In a similar fashion, the contralateral uterine artery was skeletonized and straight Heaney clamp was placed.  These ligaments bilaterally were transected and suture ligated in a left Heaney stitch.  At this point, curved Masterson was used to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex, thus was transected and suture ligated.  Straight Masterson was then used to incorporate the uterosacrals bilaterally and this was also transected and suture ligated.  Prior to ligating the uterine arteries, the uterosacral arteries were tagged bilaterally with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the roticulator was placed across the vaginal cuff and snug underneath the entire cervix.  The roticulator was then clamped and removed and the staple line was in place.  This was found to be hemostatic.  A suture was then placed through each cuff angle bilaterally and cardinal ligament complex was found to be fixed to each apex bilaterally.  At this point, McCall culdoplasty was performed with an #0 Vicryl incorporating each uterosacral as well as the posterior peritoneum.  There did appear to be good support on palpation.  Prior to this, the specimen was handed off and sent to pathology.  At this point, there did appear to be small amount of oozing at the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis was obtained using a #0 Vicryl in two single stitches.  Good hemostasis was then obtained on the cuff as well as the pedicles.  Copious irrigation was performed at this point with lactate Ringers.  The round ligaments were then incorporated into the cuff bilaterally.  Again, copious amount of irrigation was performed and good hemostasis was obtained.  At this point, the peritoneum was reapproximated in a single interrupted stitch on the left and right lateral aspects to cover each pedicle bilaterally.  At this point, the bowel packing as well as moist Ray-Tech was removed and while re-approximating the bowel it was noted that there were multiple interloop bowel adhesions which were taken down using the Metzenbaum scissors with good visualization of the underlying bowel.  Good hemostasis was obtained of these sites as well.  The sigmoid colon was then returned to its anatomic position and the omentum as well.  The rectus muscle was then reapproximated with two interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion from lateral to medial meeting in the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #3-0 plain in a running suture.  The skin was then re-approximated with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure.  This was dressed with an Op-Site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle were correct x2.  After the procedure, the patient was extubated and brought out of general anesthesia.  She will go to the floor where she will be followed postoperatively in the hospital.",Surgery

Facial asymmetry following motor vehicle accident.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Endoscopic subperiosteal midface lift using the endotine midface suspension device.,2.  Transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty with removal of a portion of the medial and middle fat pad.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 28-year-old country and western performer who was involved in a motor vehicle accident over a year ago.  Since that time, she is felt to have facial asymmetry, which is apparent in publicity photographs for her record promotions.  She had requested a procedure to bring about further facial asymmetry.  She was seen preoperatively by psychiatrist specializing in body dysmorphic disorder as well as analysis of the patient's requesting cosmetic surgery and was felt to be a psychiatrically good candidate.  She did have facial asymmetry with the bit of more fullness in higher cheekbone on the right as compared to the left.  Preoperative workup including CT scan failed to show any skeletal trauma.  The patient was counseled with regard to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the postsurgical procedure including but not limited to bleeding, infection, unacceptable cosmetic appearance, numbness of the face, change in sensation of the face, facial nerve paralysis, need for further surgery, need for revision, hair loss, etc., and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position after having been marked in the upright position while awake.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with a #6 endotracheal tube.  All appropriate measures were taken to preserve the vocal cords in a professional singer.  Local anesthesia consisting of 5/6th 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine in 1/6th 0.25% Marcaine was mixed and then injected in a regional field block fashion in the subperiosteal plane via the gingivobuccal sulcus injection on either side as well as into the temporal fossa at the level of the true temporal fascia.  The upper eyelids were injected with 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine.  Adequate time for vasoconstriction and anesthesia was allowed to be obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture was placed in the right lower lid.  For traction, it was brought anteriorly.  The conjunctiva was incised with the needle tip Bovie with Jaeger lid plate protecting the cornea and globe.  A Q-Tip was then used to separate the orbicularis oculi muscle from the fat pad beneath and carried down to the bone.  The middle and medial fat pads were identified and a small amount of fat was removed from each to take care of the pseudofat herniation, which was present.  The inferior oblique muscle was identified, preserved, and protected throughout the procedure.  The transconjunctival incision was then closed with buried knots of 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results and throughout the procedure.  Lacri-Lube was in the eyes in order to maintain hydration.  Attention was next turned to the midface, where a temporal incision was made parallel to the nasojugal folds.  Dissection was carried out with the hemostat down to the true temporal fascia and the endoscopic temporal dissection dissector was used to elevate the true temporal fascia.  A 30-degree endoscope was used to visualize the fat pads, so that we knew we are in the proper plane.  Subperiosteal dissection was carried out over the zygomatic arch and Whitnall's tubercle and the temporal dissection was completed.,Next, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were made and a Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum of the midface and anterior face of the maxilla from the tendon of the masseter muscle up to Whitnall's tubercle.  The two dissection planes within joint in the subperiosteal fashion and dissection proceeded laterally out to the zygomatic neurovascular bundle.  It was bipolar electrocauteried and the tunnel was further dissected free and opened.  The endotine 4.5 soft tissue suspension device was then inserted through the temporal incision, brought down into the subperiosteal midface plane of dissection.  The guard was removed and the suspension spikes were engaged into the soft tissues.  The spikes were elevated superiorly such that a symmetrical midface elevation was carried out bilaterally.  The endotine device was then secured to the true temporal fascia with three sutures of 3-0 PDS suture.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results in order to achieve facial symmetry and symmetry was obtained.  The gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic and the scalp incision was closed with staples.  The sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.",Ophthalmology

4518,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007.  At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy.  Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks.  She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007.  She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y.  Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.,On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure.  She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion.  Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.,She had surgical resection done yesterday.  The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis.  At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.,Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted.  Radial margin was 0.1 mm.  Other margins were 5 and 6 mm.  Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.,Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs.  The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1.  The ovaries were normal.  An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She has otherwise been feeling well.  She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy.  She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber.  She was eating well up until the time of her surgery.  She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June.  She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.,ALLERGIES: , PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.,MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:,  None.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , No significant medical problem.  She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks.  She has no prior surgeries.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s.  A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week.  She does not smoke now.  She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine.  She is married and has no children.  An IUD was recently placed.  She works as an esthetician.,FAMILY HISTORY:  ,Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45.  This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history.  She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early.  Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44.  Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago.  Otherwise, he has no medical problem.  Mother is aged 82 and healthy.  She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , ,GENERAL:  She is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.,SKIN:  Warm and dry.  She has no jaundice.,LYMPHATICS:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.,LUNGS:  There is no respiratory distress.,CARDIAC:  Regular rate.,ABDOMEN:  Soft and mildly tender.

Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.,LABORATORY DATA:,  White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6.  Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133.  Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1.  She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled.  Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.,A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.,Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.,She has a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available.  She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed.  If not, those can be drawn tomorrow.",Consult - History and Phy.

She will need evaluation with an IVP and renal scan to determine the point of obstruction and renal function of the right kidney.  She is quite anxious about her upcoming surgery and would like to delay any evaluation of this until the surgery is completed.  She will call us back to schedule the x-rays.  She understands the great importance and getting back in touch with us to schedule these x-rays due to the possibility that it may be somehow related to the cancer.  There is also a question of a stone present in the kidney.  She voiced a complete understanding of that and will call us after she recovers from her surgery to schedule these tests.",Nephrology

He is on B12, iron, folic acid, and Procrit.  There are no sign or symptom of blood loss and a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was negative.  His creatinine was 1.  My impression at this time is that he probably has an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome or bone marrow failure.  His creatinine on this hospitalization was up slightly to 1.6 and this may contribute to his anemia.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,At this time, my recommendation for the patient is that he undergoes further serologic evaluation with reticulocyte count, serum protein, and electrophoresis, LDH, B12, folate, erythropoietin level, and he should undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  I have discussed the procedure in detail which the patient.  I have discussed the risks, benefits, and successes of that treatment and usefulness of the bone marrow and predicting his cause of refractory anemia and further therapeutic interventions, which might be beneficial to him.

Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Partial tarsectomy navicula, right foot.,2.  Partial metatarsectomy, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise.",Podiatry

Nephrolithotomy.,DIAGNOSIS:,  Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.,DRAINS:,1.  Jackson-Pratt drain times one from the right flank.,2.  Foley catheter times one.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 30 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,SPECIMENS:,1.  Renal pelvis.,2.  Kidney stones.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  Sequential compression devices were also placed.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There was no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure was terminated.  The robot was undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.",Urology

This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters.  I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies.  The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates.  I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place.  We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side.  This was filled with bone and BMP as well.  Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws.  Following this, bleeding points were controlled and Dr. X proceeded with the closure of the abdomen.,SUMMARY: , This is a 51-year-old man who reports 15-year history of low back pain and intermittent bilateral leg pain and achiness.  He has tried multiple conservative treatments including physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, etc.  MRI scan shows a very degenerated disk at L5-S1, less so at L3-L4 and L4-L5.  A discogram was positive with the lower 3 levels, but he has pain, which starts below the iliac crest and I feel that the L3-L4 disk is probably that symptomatic.  An anterior lumbar interbody fusion was suggested.  Procedure, risks, and complications were explained.",Surgery

The patient's priapism did return following this and he was scheduled for cavernosaphenous shunt.,PROCEDURE:,  Informed written consent was obtained.  The patient was taken to the operative suite and administered anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion.  A #15 French Foley catheter was inserted under sterile conditions.  Incision was made in the left base of the penile shaft on the lateral aspect, approximately 3 cm in length.  Tissue was dissected down to the level of the corpora cavernosum and corpora spongiosum.  The fascia was incised in elliptical fashion for approximately 2 cm.  A #14 gauge Angiocath was inserted into the corpora cavernosum to the glans of the penis and the corpora was irrigated copiously until all of the old clotted blood was removed and fresher irrigation was noted.,Attention was then turned to the left groin and the superficial saphenous vein was harvested.  Due to incisions brought up into the initial incision after gauging enough length, this was then spatulated with Potts scissors for approximately 2 cm.  Vein was irrigated.  One branching vessel was noted to be leaking, this was tied off and repeat injection with heparinized saline showed no additional leaks.  Tunnel was then created from the superior most groin region to the incision in the penile shaft.  Saphenous vein was then passed through this tunnel with the aid of a hemostat.  Anastomosis was performed using #5-0 Prolene suture in a running fashion from proximal to distal.  There were no leaks noted.  There was good flow noted within the saphenous vein graft.

The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.

Since that time, she is felt to have facial asymmetry, which is apparent in publicity photographs for her record promotions.  She had requested a procedure to bring about further facial asymmetry.  She was seen preoperatively by psychiatrist specializing in body dysmorphic disorder as well as analysis of the patient's requesting cosmetic surgery and was felt to be a psychiatrically good candidate.  She did have facial asymmetry with the bit of more fullness in higher cheekbone on the right as compared to the left.  Preoperative workup including CT scan failed to show any skeletal trauma.  The patient was counseled with regard to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the postsurgical procedure including but not limited to bleeding, infection, unacceptable cosmetic appearance, numbness of the face, change in sensation of the face, facial nerve paralysis, need for further surgery, need for revision, hair loss, etc., and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position after having been marked in the upright position while awake.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with a #6 endotracheal tube.  All appropriate measures were taken to preserve the vocal cords in a professional singer.  Local anesthesia consisting of 5/6th 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine in 1/6th 0.25% Marcaine was mixed and then injected in a regional field block fashion in the subperiosteal plane via the gingivobuccal sulcus injection on either side as well as into the temporal fossa at the level of the true temporal fascia.  The upper eyelids were injected with 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine.  Adequate time for vasoconstriction and anesthesia was allowed to be obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture was placed in the right lower lid.  For traction, it was brought anteriorly.  The conjunctiva was incised with the needle tip Bovie with Jaeger lid plate protecting the cornea and globe.  A Q-Tip was then used to separate the orbicularis oculi muscle from the fat pad beneath and carried down to the bone.  The middle and medial fat pads were identified and a small amount of fat was removed from each to take care of the pseudofat herniation, which was present.  The inferior oblique muscle was identified, preserved, and protected throughout the procedure.  The transconjunctival incision was then closed with buried knots of 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results and throughout the procedure.  Lacri-Lube was in the eyes in order to maintain hydration.  Attention was next turned to the midface, where a temporal incision was made parallel to the nasojugal folds.  Dissection was carried out with the hemostat down to the true temporal fascia and the endoscopic temporal dissection dissector was used to elevate the true temporal fascia.  A 30-degree endoscope was used to visualize the fat pads, so that we knew we are in the proper plane.  Subperiosteal dissection was carried out over the zygomatic arch and Whitnall's tubercle and the temporal dissection was completed.,Next, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were made and a Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum of the midface and anterior face of the maxilla from the tendon of the masseter muscle up to Whitnall's tubercle.  The two dissection planes within joint in the subperiosteal fashion and dissection proceeded laterally out to the zygomatic neurovascular bundle.  It was bipolar electrocauteried and the tunnel was further dissected free and opened.  The endotine 4.5 soft tissue suspension device was then inserted through the temporal incision, brought down into the subperiosteal midface plane of dissection.  The guard was removed and the suspension spikes were engaged into the soft tissues.  The spikes were elevated superiorly such that a symmetrical midface elevation was carried out bilaterally.  The endotine device was then secured to the true temporal fascia with three sutures of 3-0 PDS suture.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results in order to achieve facial symmetry and symmetry was obtained.  The gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic and the scalp incision was closed with staples.  The sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.",Cosmetic / Plastic Surgery
85,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above.  He has history of neurogenic bladder, and on intermittent self-catheterization 3 times a day.  However, June 24, 2008, he was seen in the ER, and with fever, weakness, possible urosepsis.  He had a blood culture, which was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as urine culture noted for same bacteria.  He was treated on IV antibiotics, Dr. XYZ also saw the patient.  Discharged home.  Not taking any antibiotics.  Today in the office, the patient denies any dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills.  He is catheterizing 3 times a day, changing his catheter weekly.  Does have history of renal transplant, which has been followed by Dr. X and is on chronic steroids.  Renal ultrasound, June 23, 2008, was noted for mild hydronephrosis of renal transplant with fluid in the pericapsular space.  Creatinine, July 7, 2008 was 2.0, BUN 36, and patient tells me this is being followed by Dr. X.  No interval complaints today, no issues with catheterization or any gross hematuria.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Neurogenic bladder, in a patient catheterizing himself 3 times a day, changing his catheter 3 times a week, we again reviewed the technique of catheterization, and he has no issues with this.,2.  Recurrent urinary tract infection, in a patient who has been hospitalized twice within the last few months, he is on steroids for renal transplant, which has most likely been overall reducing his immune system.  He is asymptomatic today.  No complaints today.,PLAN:,  Following a detailed discussion with the patient, we elected to proceed with intermittent self-catheterization, changing catheter weekly, and technique has been discussed as above.  Based on the recent culture, we will place him on Keflex nighttime prophylaxis, for the next three months or so.  He will call if any concerns.  Follow up as previously scheduled in September for re-assessment.  All questions answered.  The patient is seen and evaluated by myself.",Urology

Distal Syme's amputation, left hallux with excisional biopsy.,HISTORY: , This 47-year-old Caucasian male presents to ABCD General Hospital with a history of tissue mass on his left foot.  The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.,The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed.  The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology.  Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC.",Podiatry

4557,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety.  The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills.  She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals.  The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time.  The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.,STUDY:,  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.,ORAL STAGE:  ,The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE:  ,No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  ,The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.,PLAN:  ,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.,2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.,The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.,Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.

4275,"CC:, Stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision.,HX:, This 72y/o woman was diagnosed with a left sphenoid wing meningioma on 6/3/80. She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and ""complete resection"" of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma.,The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal.",Consult - History and Phy.

4556,"REASON FOR VISIT: , This is a cosmetic consultation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a very pleasant 34-year-old white female who is a nurse in the operating room.  She knows me through the operating room and has asked me to possibly perform cosmetic surgery on her.  She is very bright and well informed about cosmetic surgery.  She has recently had some neck surgery for a re-fusion of her neck and is currently on methadone for chronic pain regarding this.  Her current desires are that she obtain a breast augmentation and liposuction of her abdomen, and she came to me mostly because I offer transumbilical breast augmentation.  Her breasts are reportedly healthy without any significant problems.  Her weight is currently stable.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: ,  Negative.  Past surgical history is significant for a second anterior cervical fusion and diskectomy in 02/05 and in 09/06.  She has had no previous cosmetic or aesthetic surgery.,FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:,  Significant for Huntington disease in her mother and diabetes in her father.  Her brother has an aneurysm.  She does occasionally smoke and has been trying to quit recently.  She is currently smoking about a pack a day.  She drinks about once a week.  She is currently a registered nurse, circulator, and scrub technician in the operating room at Hopkins.  She has no children.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,A 12-system review is significant for some musculoskeletal pain, mostly around her neck and thoracic region.  She does have occasional rash on her chest and problems with sleep and anxiety that are related to her chronic pain.  She has considered difficult airway due to anterior cervical disk fusion and instability.  Her last mammogram was in 2000.  She has a size 38C breast.,MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are 5 mg of methadone three times a day and amitriptyline at night as needed.,ALLERGIES: , None.,FINDINGS: , On exam today, the patient has good posture, good physique, good skin tone.  She is tanned.  Her lower abdomen has some excess adiposity.  There is some mild laxity of the lower abdominal skin.  Her umbilicus is oval shaped and of adequate caliber for a transumbilical breast augmentation.  There was no piercing in that region.  Her breasts are C shaped.  They are not ptotic.  They have good symmetry with no evidence of tubular breast deformity.  She has no masses or lesions noted.  The nipples are of appropriate size and shape for a woman of her age.  Her scar on her neck from her anterior cervical disk fusion is well healed.  Hopefully, our scars would be similar to this.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , Hypomastia.  I think her general physique and body habitus would accommodate about 300 to 350 cubic centimeter implant nicely.  This would make her fill out her clothes much better, and I think transumbilical technique in her is a good option.  I have discussed with her the other treatment options, and she does not want scars around her breasts if at all possible.  I think her lower abdominal skin is of good tone.  I think suction lipectomy in this region would bring down her size and accentuate her waist nicely.  I am a little concerned about the lower abdominal skin laxity, and I will discuss with her further that in the near future if this continues to be a problem, she may need a mini tummy tuck.  I do think that a liposuction is a reasonable alternative and we could see how much skin tightening she gets after the adiposity is removed.  I will try to set this up in the near future.  I will try to set this up to get the instrumentation from the instrumentation rep for the transumbilical breast augmentation procedure.  Due to her neck issues, we may not be able to perform her surgery but I will check with Dr. X to see if she is comfortable giving her deep sedation and no general anesthetic with her neck being fused.",Consult - History and Phy.
1211,"PROCEDURES,1.  Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.,2.  Arthroscopic subacromial decompression.,3.  Arthroscopic extensive debridement, superior labrum anterior and posterior tear.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic.  Once the patient was under general anesthetic, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  The patient was then carefully positioned into a beach-chair position.  We maintained the natural alignment of the head, neck, and thorax at all times.  The shoulder and upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,Once we fully prepped and draped, we then began the surgery.  We injected the glenohumeral joint with sterile saline with a spinal needle.  This consisted of 60 cc of fluid.  We then made a posterior incision for our portal, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar and cannula were placed in the glenohumeral joint.  Through the cannula, a camera was placed; and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline through a preoperative feed.  We then carefully examined the glenohumeral joint.,We found the articular surface to be in good condition.  There was a superior labral tear (SLAP).  This was extensively debrided using a shaver through an anterior portal.  We also found a full thickness rotator cuff tear.  We then drained the glenohumeral joint.  We redirected our camera into the subacromial space.  An anterolateral portal was made, both superior and inferior.,We then proceeded to perform a subacromial decompression using high-speed shaver.  The bursa was extensively debrided.  We then abraded the bone over the footprint of where the rotator cuff is usually attached.  The corkscrew anchors were used to perform a rotator cuff repair.  Pictures were taken.,Through a separate incision, an indwelling pain catheter was then placed.  It was carefully positioned.  Pictures were taken.  We then drained the joint.  All instruments were removed.  The patient did receive IV antibiotic preoperatively.  All portals were closed using 4-0 nylon sutures.,Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and OpSite were applied over the pain pump.  ABD, tape, and a sling were also applied.  A Cryo/Cuff was also placed over the shoulder.  The patient was taken out of the beach-chair position maintaining the neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax.  The patient was extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.  I then went out and spoke with the family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care.",Surgery
555,"PROCEDURE: , Medial branch rhizotomy, lumbosacral.,INFORMED CONSENT:,  The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,SEDATION: , The patient was given conscious sedation and monitored throughout the procedure.  Oxygenation was given.  The patient's oxygenation and vital signs were closely followed to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.  The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***.  Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen.  Needle localization was confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs.,The following technique was used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves.  Sensory stimulation was applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesias were noted at,*** volts.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement was noted at *** volts.,Following this, the needle Trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue.  After completion of each nerve block a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.  No complications.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.,DISCUSSION: , Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made in approximately 1 week.",Surgery

1905,"Sample Address,RE:  Sample Patient,Dear Doctor:,We had the pleasure of seeing Abc and his mother in the clinic today.  As you certainly know, he is now a 9-month-old male product of a twin gestation complicated by some very mild prematurity.  He has been having problems with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath over the last several months.  You and your partners have treated him aggressively with inhaled steroids and bronchodilator.  Despite this, however; he has had persistent problems with a cough and has been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone as well as a more prolonged alternating day course.  ,Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problems with asthma as well as his older sister.  The parents now maintain separate households and there has been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house.  ,On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchi which cleared with coughing but was otherwise healthy.  ,We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principles of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.  I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably does have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately has avoided hospitalization.  ,I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroids until he is completely symptom free on the days off steroids but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to as low as 1.5 milligrams (0.5 milliliters on alternate days).  I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer questions if necessary by phone.,Thanks so much for allowing us to be involved in his care.  ,Sincerely,",Pediatrics - Neonatal

The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",Surgery
744,"NAME OF PROCEDURE,1.  Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography.,2.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,HISTORY: , This is a 58-year-old male who presented with atypical chest discomfort.  The patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  The patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease, therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , Informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  The patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, 2% Xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Then, the patient had already been on heparin.  Then, a Judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  A 3DRC catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  Then, a 3DRC guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Then, a universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery.  Integrilin was given.  Then, a 3.0 x 12 Voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds.  Then, a projection was obtained.  Then, a 3.0 x 15 Vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery.  The stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds.  Post stent, the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection.  Then, there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful.  Then, a pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion.  Then, attempt to place the 2.0 x 8 power saver across the lesion was performed.  However, it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed.  Then, the stent delivery system was removed.  A pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle.  Hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed.  Then, a pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed.  Then, the right femoral artery was visualized and using angiography and then an Angio-Seal was applied.  The patient was transferred back to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics:  The opening aortic pressure was 116/61 with a mean of 64.  The opening left ventricular pressure was 112 with end-diastolic pressure of 23.  LV pressure on pullback was 106 with end-diastolic pressure of 21.  Aortic pressure was 111/67 with a mean of 87.  The closing pressure was 110/67.,2.  Left ventriculography:  The left ventricle was of normal cavity, size, and wall thickness.  There is a mild anterolateral hypokinesis and moderate inferior and inferoapical hypokinesis.  The overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40% and 45%.  The mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation.  The aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally.,3.  Coronary angiography:  The left main is a normal-caliber vessel.  This bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  The left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left anterior descending is a large vessel that extends to the apex.  It gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches.  The first diagonal branch was large.  The left anterior descending had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel, which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches.  The two obtuse marginal branches are large.  There is a relatively small left atrial branch.  The left circumflex had a 50% stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch.  The rest of the vessel is moderately irregular, but no high-grade disease.  The right coronary artery appears to be a dominant vessel, which gives rise to three right ventricular branches, four posterior lateral branches, two right atrial branches, and two small conus branches.  The right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high-grade disease.  However, distal between the second and third posterolateral branch, there is a 90% stenosis.  The rest of the vessels had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  Then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in a 20% residual stenosis.  Then, after stent placement there was 0% residual stenosis; however, there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch.  Then, a wire was advanced through this and there was improvement of flow.  There is improvement from TIMI grade 2 to TIMI grade 3 flow.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION,1.  Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,2.  Two-vessel coronary artery disease.,3.  Elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.,4.  Mild anterolateral and moderate inferoapical hypokinesis.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  Integrilin.,2.  Bed rest.,3.  Risk factor modification.,4.  Thallium scintigraphy in approximately six weeks.",Surgery

Cortisone injection, left carpal tunnel.,ANESTHESIA: , General LMA.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATIONS:,  This patient is a 50-year-old male with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, which is measured out as severe.  He is scheduled for the above-mentioned procedures.  The planned procedures were discussed with the patient including the associated risks.  The risks included but are not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, possible need for reoperation, possible recurrence, or any associated risk of the anesthesia.  He voiced understanding and agreed to proceed as planned.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified in the holding area and correct operative site was identified by the surgeon's mark.  Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was then brought to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in supine position.  Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification.,After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm.  Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision.  Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery.  Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision.  Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band.  Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed.  This was confirmed by visually and palpably.  Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision.  Carpal canal was then inspected.  The median nerve was flattened and injected.  No other abnormalities were noted.  Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive.  Decadron 4 mg was then placed adjacent to the median nerve.  Skin incision was then closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon suture.  The wound was then dressed with Adaptic, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was then deflated.  Attention was then directed to the left side.  Using sterile technique, the left carpal canal was injected with a mixture of 40 mg of Depo-Medrol, 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, and 1 cc of 0.25% Marcaine.  Band-Aid was then placed over the injection site.  The patient was then awakened, extubated, and transferred over to his hospital bed.  He was transported to recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications.  All counts were reported as correct.",Surgery
4488,"REASON FOR VISIT: , The patient is an 84-year-old man who returns for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.  He is accompanied by his wife and daughter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  I first saw him nearly a year ago on December 20, 2007.  At that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months.  This included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence.  He had actually been evaluated at Hospital with CSF drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there was no response that was noted.  When I saw him, there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and I ordered an MRI scan of the cervical spine.  I subsequently referred him to Dr. X, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on July 16, 2008.  According to his notes this went well.,According to the family, there has not been any improvement.,With regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago.  He is virtually unable to walk at all.  He needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk.  Therefore, he is always in the wheelchair.,He is completely incontinent.  He never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom.  On the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he needs to go.  He wears a Depends undergarment all the time.,He has no headaches.,His thinking and memory are worse.  For the most part, he is apathetic.  He does not talk very much.  He lives in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section.  He does have some daytime activities.  He takes a nap once a day.  He does not read very much.  On the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election.  He needs full assistance at the nursing home.,MEDICATIONS:,  From the list by the nursing home are Aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three times a day, citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (Proscar) 5 mg once a day, Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, Tylenol 650 mg as needed, and promethazine 25 mg as needed.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , On examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair.  He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respirations 16, and blood pressure 123/71.,Head:  The head is normocephalic and atraumatic.,Mental Status:  Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge.  The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 14/30.  He was not at all oriented.  He did know we were at Sinai Hospital on the second floor.  He could spell 'world' forward, but was mute when asked to spell backwards.  He was mute when asked to recall 3/3 objects for delayed recall.  He could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons.  For comparison, the Mini-Mental State exam score last December was 20/30 when attention was tested by having him spell 'world' backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions.  Additionally, there are times when he stutters or stammers.  I do not see any paraphasic errors.  There is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia.  He is also stimulus bound.  There is a tendency to mimic.,Cranial Nerve Exam:  There is no upgaze that I can elicit today.  The horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact.  This is a change from a year ago.  The muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement.,Motor Exam:  Normal bulk and strength.  The tone is characterized by paratonia.  There is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor.,Sensory Exam:  Intact to light touch.,Cerebellar Exam:  Intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands.,Gait:  Severely impaired.  When in the wheelchair, he leans to one side.  He cannot getup on his own.  He needs assistance.  Once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance.  This would amount to a Tinetti score of zero.,REVIEW OF X-RAYS: , I personally reviewed the CT scan of the brain from November 1, 2008 and compared it to the MRI scan from a year ago.  The ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago.  The frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm.  The 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm.  There is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy.  The scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient has had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence.  The new finding for me today is the limited upgaze.  This would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Possible supranuclear palsy.,3.  Severe gait impairment.,4.  Urinary urgency and incontinence.,5.  Dementia.,PLAN: , I had a long talk with him and his family.  Even though he has already had a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter at Hospital over a year ago, I offered this test to them again.  I do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan.  His family and I discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus.  Instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference.  I have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed.  I gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives.  I specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection.",Consult - History and Phy.

2707,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  Mr. A is an 86-year-old man who returns for his first followup after shunt surgery.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,I have followed Mr. A since May 2008.  He presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control.  We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June of 2008 and ,Mr. A underwent shunt surgery performed by Dr. X on August 1st.  A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.,Mr. A comes today with his daughter, Pam and together they give his history.,Mr. A has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him.  With respect to his walking, his daughter tells me that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but could not before his surgery.  His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment.  With respect to his bladder, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper.,With respect to his cognition, both Pam and the patient say that his thinking has improved.  The other daughter, Patty summarized it best according to two of them.  She said, ""I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.""  Mr. A has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or at the abdomen.,MEDICATIONS: , Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Detrol LA 4 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Imodium daily, Omega-3, fish oil, and Lasix.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  Mr. A is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.,The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.,Mental Status:  Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge.  He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations.  Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice.  This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.,Gait:  Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool.  He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28.  This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Face symmetric.  No dysarthria.,Motor:  Normal for bulk and strength.,Coordination:  Slow for finger-to-nose.,IMAGING: , CT scan was reviewed from 10/15/2008.  It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm.  By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection.  This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections.  There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.,ASSESSMENT: , Mr. A has made some improvement since shunt surgery.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Adult hydrocephalus (331.5).,2.  Gait impairment (781.2).,3.  Urinary incontinence and urgency (788.33).,4.  Cognitive impairment (290.0).,PLAN:,  I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter.  We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.  I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.,Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again.  Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test.  I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe ,Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time.  I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.",Neurosurgery

After general mask anesthesia was adequately obtained, the right external auditory canal was cleaned out under the microscope.  Serous fluid was aspirated from the middle ear space.  An Armstrong grommet tube was placed down through the incision and rotated into place.  The opposite ear was then cleaned out under the microscope.  Serous fluid was aspirated from the middle ear space.  An Armstrong grommet tube was placed down through the incision and rotated into place.  Cortisporin suspension was placed in both ear canals.,Then the patient was intubated.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed into the mouth and extended and hung on the Mayo stand.  The red rubber catheter was placed down through the nose and brought out through the mouth to retract the palate.  The adenoid fossa was visualized with the mirror.  The adenoids were removed using the microdebrider.  Two adenoid packs were placed.  The packs were removed one by one.  Using mirror and suction bovie, adequate hemostasis was achieved.,The tonsils were quite large and cryptic.  The tenaculum was placed on the superior pole of the right tonsil.  Cheesy material came out from the crypts.  The tonsils were retracted medially.  The bovie electrocautery was used to make an incision in the right anterior tonsillar pillar, and the plane was developed between the tonsil and the musculature.  The tonsil was completely dissected out of this plane, preserving both the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars.  All bleeders were cauterized as they were encountered.  The tenaculum was then placed on the superior pole of the left tonsil.  Cheesy material came out from the crypts.  The tonsils were retracted medially.  The bovie electrocautery was used to make an incision in the left anterior tonsillar pillar, and the plane was developed between the tonsil and the musculature.

The patient was felt to be a candidate for decompression stabilization pulling distraction between the screws to relieve radicular pain.  The patient understood major risks and complications such as death and paralysis seemingly rare, main concern is a 10 to 15% of failure rate to respond to surgery for which further surgery may or may not be indicated, small risk of wound infection, spinal fluid leak.  The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was intubated.  Foley catheter was in place.  The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped.  A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel.  The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala.  Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone.  The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting.  The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints.  Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed.  Pars interarticularis were maintained.  Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise.  Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side.  Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe.  It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body.  At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed.  Good bone purchase was obtained.  Gelfoam was placed over the roots laterally, corticated transverse processes lateral facet joints were prepared, small infuse sponge was placed posterolaterally on the right side, then the local bone graft from L4 to S1.  Traction was applied between the L4-L5, L5-S1 screws locking notes were tightened out, heads were rotated fractured off about 2-3 mm traction were applied at each side, further opening the foramen for the exiting roots.  Prior to placement of BMP, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic irrigation.  Medium Hemovac drain was placed in the depth of wound, brought out through a separate stab incision.  Deep fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous fascia with #1 Vicryl, and subcuticular with 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was stapled.  The drain was sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl and connected to closed drain system.  The patient was laid supine on the bed, extubated, and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.

Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion.  Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis.  I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally.  I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area.  Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side.  Great care was taken with placement.  A good plane was positively identified.  I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament.,Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me.  I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament.  I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified.  I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament.  I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament.  I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect.  I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time.  Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut.  Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut.  Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin.  The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition.",Surgery

Organic brain syndrome.,4. Seizure disorder.,5. Adrenal insufficiency.,6. Hypothyroidism.,7. Anemia of chronic disease.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted through the emergency room.  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  He was rewarmed and had blood, sputum, and urine cultures done.  He was placed on IV Rocephin.  His usual medications of Dilantin and Depakene were given.  The patient's hypertension was treated with fluid boluses.  The patient was empirically placed on Synthroid and hydrocortisone by Dr. X.  Blood work consisted of a chemistry panel that was unremarkable, except for decreased proteins.  H&H was stable at 33.3/10.9 and platelets of 80,000.  White blood cell counts were normal, differential was normal.  TSH was 3.41.  Free T4 was 0.9.  Dr. X felt this was consistent with secondary hypothyroidism and recommended Synthroid replacement.  A cortisol level was obtained prior to administration of hydrocortisone.  This was 10.9 and that was not a fasting level.  Dr. X felt because of his hypothyroidism and his hypothermia that he had secondary adrenal insufficiency and recommended hydrocortisone and Florinef.  The patient was eventually changed to prednisone 2.5 mg b.i.d. in addition to his Florinef 0.1 mg on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  The patient was started back on his tube feeds.  He tolerated these poorly with residuals.  Reglan was increased to 10 mg q.6 h. and erythromycin is being added.  The patient's temperature has been stable in the 94 to 95 range.  Other vital signs have been stable.  His urine output has been diminished.  An external jugular line was placed in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's legal guardian, Janet Sanchez in Albuquerque has requested he be transported there.  As per several physicians in Albuquerque and Dr. Y, an internist, we will accept him once we have a nursing home available to him.  He is being transported back to the nursing home today and discharge planners are working on getting him a nursing home in Albuquerque.  His prognosis is poor.",General Medicine
908,"DELIVERY NOTE: , The patient is a very pleasant 22-year-old primigravida with prenatal care with both Dr. X and myself and her pregnancy has been uncomplicated except for the fact that she does live a significant distance away from the hospital.  The patient was admitted to labor and delivery on Tuesday, December 22, 2008 at 5:30 in the morning at 40 weeks and 1 day gestation for elective induction of labor since she lives a significant distance away from the hospital.  Her cervix on admission was not ripe, so she was given a dose of Cytotec 25 mcg intravaginally and in the afternoon, she was having frequent contractions and fetal heart tracing was reassuring.  At a later time, Pitocin was started.  The next day at about 9 o'clock in the morning, I checked her cervix and performed artifical rupture of membranes, which did reveal Meconium-stained amniotic fluid and so an intrauterine pressure catheter was placed and then MDL infusion started.  The patient did have labor epidural, which worked well.  It should be noted that the patient's recent vaginal culture for group B strep did come back negative for group B strep.  The patient went on to have a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live-term male newborn with Apgar scores of 7 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively and a newborn weight of 7 pounds and 1.5 ounces at birth.  The intensive care nursery staff was present because of the presence of Meconium-stained amniotic fluid.  DeLee suctioning was performed at the perineum.  A second-degree midline episiotomy was repaired in layers in the usual fashion using 3-0 Vicryl.  The placenta was simply delivered and examined and found to be complete and bimanual vaginal exam was performed and revealed that the uterus was firm.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 300 mL.",Surgery
3988,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 56-year-old female who comes in for a dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease and weight reduction.  The patient states that her husband has been diagnosed with high blood cholesterol as well.  She wants some support with some dietary recommendations to assist both of them in healthier eating.  The two of them live alone now, and she is used to cooking for large portions.  She is having a hard time adjusting to preparing food for the two of them.  She would like to do less food preparation, in fact.  She is starting a new job this week.,OBJECTIVE:,  Her reported height is 5 feet 4 inches.  Today’s weight was 170 pounds.  BMI is approximately 29.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on a 1200 calorie meal plan emphasizing low-saturated fat sources with moderate amounts of sodium as well.  Information on fast food eating was supplied, and additional information on low-fat eating was also supplied.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient’s basal energy expenditure is estimated at 1361 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirement for weight maintenance is estimated at 1759 calories a day.  Her diet history reflects that she is making some very healthy food choices on a regular basis.  She does emphasize a lot of fruits and vegetables, trying to get a fruit or a vegetable or both at most meals.  She also is emphasizing lower fat selections.  Her physical activity level is moderate at this time.  She is currently walking for 20 minutes four or five days out of the week but at a very moderate pace with a friend.  We reviewed the efforts at weight reduction identifying 3500 calories in a pound of body fat and the need to gradually and slowly chip away at this number on a long-term basis for weight reduction.  We discussed the need to reduce calories from what her current patterns are and to hopefully increase physical activity slightly as well.  We discussed menu selection, as well as food preparation techniques.  The patient appears to have been influenced by the current low-carb, high-protein craze and had really limited her food selections based on that.  I was able to give her some more room for variety including some moderate portions of potatoes, pasta and even on occasion breading her meat as long as she prepares it in a low-fat fashion which was discussed.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient increase the intensity and the duration of her physical activity with a goal of 30 minutes five days a week working at a brisk walk.  Recommend the patient reduce calories by 500 daily to support a weight loss of one pound a week.  This translates into a 1200-calorie meal plan.  I encouraged the patient to keep food records in order to better track calories consumed.  I recommended low fat selections and especially those that are lower in saturated fats.  Emphasis would be placed on moderating portions of meat and having more moderate snacks between meals as well.  This was a one-hour consultation.  I provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",Diets and Nutritions

The patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity.  He denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries.  Because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the S1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on.  After an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient.  ,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,He was wheeled back to Operating Room #5 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/28/03.  After a general anesthetic was administered, a Foley catheter was inserted.,The patient was then turned prone on the Jackson table.  All of his bony prominences were well-padded.  At this time, a myelogram was then performed.  After the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram.  The needle was localized to the level of L3-L4 region.  Once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle.  At this time, approximately 10 cc of Conray injected into the thecal sac.  The patient was then placed in the reversed Trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast.  The myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of L5-S1 on the left.  There was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the AP and the lateral projections using C-arm fluoroscopy.  At this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy.  A long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right.  The surgery was going to be on the left.  Once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the L5-S1 nerve root region.  At this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia.  At this time, a Weitlaner was inserted.  Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  We further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina.  A Cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side.  At this time, a Taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction.  Suction as well as Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, a small Kerrison Rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression.  Once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots.  Once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the S1 nerve root, which was compressive.  We removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the S1 nerve root.  A nerve root retractor was then placed.  Identification of disc space was then performed.  A #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade.  A small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed.  The part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc.  Once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free.,At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  We then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur.  At this time, a small piece of Gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root.  We did not have any dural leaks during this case.  #1-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Sterile dressings were then applied.  The patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  At this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level.",Orthopedic
1145,"PROCEDURE: , Fiberoptic bronchoscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right lung atelectasis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Extensive mucus plugging in right main stem bronchus.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was carried out at the bedside in the medical ICU after Versed 0.5 mg intravenously given in 2 aliquots.  The patient was breathing supplemental nasal and mask oxygen throughout the procedure.  Saturations and vital signs remained stable throughout.  A flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was passed through the right naris.  The vocal cords were visualized.  Secretions in the larynx were as aspirated.  As before, he had a mucocele at the right anterior commissure that did not obstruct the glottic opening.  The ports were anesthetized and the trachea entered.  There was no cough reflex helping explain the propensity to aspiration and mucus plugging.  Tracheal secretions were aspirated.  The main carinae were sharp.  However, there were thick, sticky, grey secretions filling the right mainstem bronchus up to the level of the carina.  This was gradually lavaged clear.  Saline and Mucomyst solution were used to help dislodge remaining plugs.  The airways appeared slightly friable, but were patent after the airways were suctioned.  O2 saturations remained in the mid-to-high 90s.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Specimens were submitted for microbiologic examination.  Despite his frail status, he tolerated bronchoscopy quite well.",Surgery

Osteomyelitis, paraplegia, and history of spina bifida.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Debridement left ischial ulcer.,ANESTHESIA: ,Local MAC.,INDICATIONS:,  This is a 27-year-old white male patient, with a history of spina bifida who underwent spinal surgery about two years ago and subsequently he has been paraplegic.  The patient has a nonhealing decubitus ulcer in the left ischial region, which is quite deep.  It appears to be right down to the bone.  MRI shows findings suggestive of osteomyelitis.  The patient is being brought to operating room for debridement of this ulcer.  Procedure, indication, and risks were explained to the patient.  Consent obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: ,The patient was put in right lateral position and left buttock and ischial region was prepped and draped.  Examination at this time showed fair amount of chronic granulation tissue and scarred tissue circumferentially as well as the base of this decubitus ulcer.  This was sharply excised until bleeding and healthy tissue was obtained circumferentially as well as the base.  The ulcer does not appear to be going into the bone itself as there was a covering on the bone, which appears to be quite healthy, normal and bone itself appeared solid.,I did not rongeur the bone.  The deeper portion of the excised tissue was also sent for tissue cultures.  Hemostasis was achieved with cautery and the wound was irrigated with sterile saline solution and then packed with medicated Kerlix.  Sterile dressing was applied.

Left ventriculography.,INDICATIONS: , Persistent chest pain on maximum medical therapy with known history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in year 2000.,PROCEDURE: , After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the above-mentioned procedure were explained to the patient in detail, an informed consent was obtained both verbally and in writing.  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was then used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was then inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin and its pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  A #6 French sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Next, angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of the guidewire.  The catheter was then advanced into the left ventricle.  The guidewire was then removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  LVEDP was then measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  The left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO position with a single power injection of non-ionic contrast material.  LVEDP was then remeasured.  Pullback was then performed, which failed to reveal an LVAO gradient.  The catheter was then removed.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was removed.  Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the saphenous vein graft was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  The saphenous vein graft was visualized in several different views.  The Judkins right catheter was then advanced and the native coronary artery was engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  Right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was retracted.  We were unable to engage the left subclavian artery thus the catheter was removed over an exchange wire.  Next, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the exchange wire.  The wire was then easily passed into the left subclavian artery.  The multipurpose catheter was then removed.  LIMA catheter was then exchanged over the wire into the left subclavian artery.  The guidewire was removed and the catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  LIMA graft was then engaged using hand injections of non-ionic contrast material.  The LIMA graft was evaluated in several different views.  Once adequate study has been performed, the LIMA catheter was retracted under fluoroscopic guidance.  The sheath was flushed for the final time.  The patient was returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable and satisfactory condition.,FINDINGS:,LEFT VENTRICULOGRAM: , There is no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%.  Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 24 mmHg preinjection and 26 mmHg postinjection.  There is no mitral regurgitation.

4895,"HISTORY: , The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted yesterday with the recurrence of such in a setting of hypokalemia, incomplete compliance with obstructive sleep apnea therapy with CPAP, chocolate/caffeine ingestion and significant mental stress.  Despite repletion of her electrolytes and maintenance with Diltiazem IV she has maintained atrial fibrillation.  I have discussed in detail with the patient regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure.  After an in depth discussion of the procedure (please see my initial consultation for further details) I asked the patient this morning if she would like me to repeat that as that discussion had happened yesterday.  The patient declined.  I invited questions for her which she stated she had none and wanted to go forward with the cardioversion which seemed appropriate.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol including proper identification of the patient, physician, procedure, documentation, and there were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff.  The patient participated actively in this.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed then and 50 micrograms of fentanyl with utilizing titrated conscious sedation with good effect.  She was placed in the supine position and hands free patches had previously been placed in the AP position and she received one synchronized cardioversion attempt after Diltiazem drip had been turned off with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm.  This was confirmed on 12 lead EKG.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , Successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from recurrent atrial fibrillation.  The patient's electrolytes are now normal and that will need close watching to avoid hypokalemia in the future, as well as she has been previously counseled for strict adherence to sleep apnea therapy with CPAP and perhaps repeat sleep evaluation would be appropriate to titrate her settings, as well as avoidance of caffeine ingestion including chocolate and minimization of mental stress.  She will be discharged on her usual robust AV nodal antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. daily and digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily and to be clear she does have a permanent pacemaker implanted.  She will follow-up with her regular cardiologist, Dr. X, for whom I am covering this weekend.,This was all discussed in detail with the patient, as well as her granddaughter with the patient's verbal consent at the bedside.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

The old right frontal scalp incision was reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter was identified as it went into the right frontal horn.  The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped.  Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around.  We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction.  A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle.  It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin and closed in a routine manner using two 3-0 Vicryl for the galea and a 4-0 running Monocryl for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient was awakened and extubated having tolerated the procedure well without complications.  It should be noted that the when we were irrigating through the ventricular catheter, fluid easily came out around the catheter indicating that the patient had partial proximal obstruction so that we could probably flow around the old shunt tract and perhaps this was leading to some of the symptomatology or findings of fluid along the chest.",Surgery

This afternoon, when I am seeing the patient, nursing informs me that rate has finally been controlled with esmolol, but systolic blood pressures have dropped to the 70s with a MAP of 52.  Dr. X was again consulted from the bedside.  We agreed to try fluid boluses and then to consider Neo-Synephrine pressure support if this is not successful.  In addition, over the last 24 hours, extensive discussions have been held with the family and questions answered by nursing staff concerning the patient's possible move to Tahoe Pacific or a long-term acute care.

The patient states that she was knocked over by her friend's dog.  She sustained a subcapital left hip fracture.  Prior to admission, she lived alone in Terrano, was ambulating with a walker.  All risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure were then discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained.,HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS: , A 28 mm medium head was used, a small cemented femoral stem was used, and a 28 x 46 cup was used.,PROCEDURE:  ,All risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  She was then transferred from the preoperative care unit to operating suite #1.  Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic without complications.,After this, the patient was transferred to the operating table and positioned.  All bony prominences were well padded.  She was positioned on a beanbag in the right lateral decubitus position with the left hip facing upwards.  The left lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the normal fashion.  A skin maker was then used to mark all bony prominences.  Skin incision was then carried out extending from the greater trochanter in a curvilinear fashion posteriorly across the buttocks.  A #10 blade Bard-Parker scalpel was used to incise the skin through to the subcutaneous tissues.  A second #10 blade was then used to incise through the subcutaneous tissue down to the fascia lata.  This was then incised utilizing Metzenbaum scissors.  This was taken down to the bursa, which was removed utilizing a rongeur.  Utilizing a periosteal elevator as well as the sponge, the fat was then freed from the short external rotators of the left hip after these were placed and stretched.  The sciatic nerve was then visualized and retracted utilizing a Richardson retractor.  Bovie was used to remove the short external rotators from the greater trochanter, which revealed the joint capsule.  The capsule was cleared and incised utilizing a T-shape incision.  A fracture hematoma was noted upon entering the joint capsule as well as subcapital hip fracture.  A cork screw was then used to remove the fractured femoral head, which was given to the scrub tech which was sized on the back table.  All bony remnants were then removed from the acetabulum and surrounding soft tissue with a rongeur.  Acetabulum was then inspected and found to be clear.  Attention was then turned to the proximal femur where a cutting tunnel was used to mark the femur for the femoral neck cut.  An oscillating saw was then used to make the femoral cut.  Box osteotome was then used to remove the bone from proximal femur.  A Charnley awl was then used to open the femoral canal, paying close attention to keep the awl in the lateral position.  Next, attention was turned to broaching.  Initially, a small broach was placed, first making efforts to lateralize the broach then the femoral canal.  It was felt that the patient has less benefit from a cemented prosthesis and a small size was appropriate.  Next, the trial components were inserted consisting of the above-mentioned component sizes.  The hip was taken through range of motion and tested to adduction, internal and external rotations as well as with a shuck and a posterior directed force on a flexed tip.  It was noted that these size were stable through the range of motion.  Next, the trial components were removed and the femoral canal was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried utilizing Super sucker and __________ then inserted pressuring the femoral canal.  The femoral component was then inserted and then held under pressure.  Extruding cement was removed from the proximal femur.  After the cement had fully hardened and dried, the head and cup were applied.  The hip was subsequently reduced and taken again through range of motion, which was felt to be stable.,Next, the capsule was closed utilizing #1 Ethibond in figure-of-eight fashion.  Next, the fascia lata was repaired utilizing a figure-of-eight Ethibond sutures.  The most proximal region at the musculotendinous junction was repaired utilizing a running #1 Vicryl suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated again to suction dry.  Next, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated using #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures.  The skin was then reapproximated utilizing skin clips.  Sterile dressing was applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs as well as foam tape.  The patient was then transferred from the operating table to the gurney.  Leg lengths were checked, which were noted to be equal and abduction pillow was placed.  The patient was then transferred to the Postoperative Care Unit in stable condition.",Orthopedic
3155,"INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY,Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a complex set of procedures which requires appropriate positioning and immobilization typically with customized immobilization devices.  The treatment planning process requires at least 4 hours of physician time.  The technology is appropriate in this patient's case due to the fact that the target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.  Sequential CT scans are obtained and transferred to the treatment planning software.  Extensive analysis occurs.  The target volumes, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected.  In addition, organs at risk are outlined.  Doses are selected both for targets, as well as for organs at risk.  Associated dose constraints are placed.  Inverse treatment planning is then performed in conjunction with the physics staff.  These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician.  Multiple beam arrangements may be tested for appropriateness and optimal dose delivery in order to maximize the chance of controlling disease, while minimizing exposure to organs at risk.

1197,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Displace subcapital fracture, left hip.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Displace subcapital fracture, left hip.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Austin-Moore bipolar hemiarthroplasty, left hip utilizing a medium fenestrated femoral stem with a medium 0.8 mm femoral head, a 50 mm bipolar cup.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to OR #2, administered a subarachnoid block anesthetic and was then positioned in the right lateral decubitus position on the beanbag on the operative table.  The right lower extremity was protectively padded.  The left leg was propped with multiple blankets.  The hip was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior incision was made on the posterolateral aspect of the left hip down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly.  The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa.  Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line.  They were then reflected distally.  The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery.  Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint.  The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum.  Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum.  The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris.  The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated.,A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur.  The T-handle broach was then passed down the canal.  The canal was then sequentially broached up to a medium broach.  The calcar was then plained with the hand plainer.  The trial components were positioned into place.  The medium component fit fairly well with the medium 28 mm femoral head.  Once the trial reduction was performed, the hip was taken through range of motion.  There was physiologic crystalling with longitudinal traction.  There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees.  The trial implants were then removed.  The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit.  The implant was then impacted into place.  The 28 mm femoral head was impacted on the mortise stapler of the femoral stem followed by placement of the 50 mm bipolar cup.  The acetabulum was once again inspected, was free of debris.  The hip was reduced.  It was taken through full range of motion.  There was no tendency for dislocation.  The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Ethibond suture.  External rotators were then reapproximated to the posterior intertrochanteric line utilizing #1 Ethibond in a modified Kessler type stitch.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Gluteus fascia was approximated with interrupted #1 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous layers were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples.  A bulky dressing was applied to the wound.  The patient was then transferred to the hospital bed, an abductor pillow was positioned into place.  Circulatory status was intact to the extremity at completion of the case.",Surgery

The most recent one which I performed quite a number of years ago that was complicated by a bone flap infection and he has had removal of his bone flap.  He has been without the bone flap for a number of years now but has finally decided that he wanted to proceed with a cranioplasty.  After discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery, the decision was made to proceed with operative intervention in the form of a cranioplasty.  He had previously undergone a CT scan.  Premanufactured cranioplasty made for him that was sterile and ready to implant.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, an appropriate time out was performed.  We identified the patient, the location of surgery, the appropriate surgical procedure, and the appropriate implant.  He was given intravenous antibiotics with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl appropriately for antibiotic prophylaxis and sequential compression devices were used for deep venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.  The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A previous incision was reopened and the scalp flap was reflected forward.  We dissected off the dura and we were able to get a nice plane of dissection elevating the temporalis muscle along with the scalp flap.  We freed up the bony edges circumferentially, but except for the inferior frontal region where the vascularized pericranial graft took its vascular supply from we did not come across the base.  We did explore laterally and saw a little bit of the mesh on the lateral orbit.  Once we had the bony edges explored, we took the performed plate and secured it in a place with titanium plates and screws.  We had achieved good hemostasis.  The wound was closed in multiple layers in usual fashion over a Blake drain.  At the end of the procedure, all sponge and needle counts were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition after having tolerated the procedure well.  I was personally present and scrubbed and performed/supervised all key portions.",Surgery

He was doing fairly well until last week while mowing the lawn, he injured his right foot.  He presented to the Hospital Emergency Room.  Cultures taken from the wound on 06/25/2008, were reported positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).  The patient was started on intravenous antibiotic therapy with Levaquin and later on that was changed to oral formulation.  The patient underwent debridement of the wound on 07/29/2008.  Apparently, MRI and a bone scan was performed at that facility, which was reported negative for osteomyelitis.  The patient was then referred to the wound care center at General Hospital.  From there, he has been admitted to Long-Term Acute Care Facility for wound care with wound VAC placement.  On exam, he has a lacerated wound on the plantar aspect of the right foot, which extends from the second metatarsal area to the fifth metatarsal area, closed with the area of the head of these bones.  The wound itself is deep and stage IV and with exam of her gloved finger in my opinion, the third metatarsal bone is palpable, which leads to the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis.

He has undergone debridement on 07/29/2008.  Culture results from the debridement procedure are not available.  Wound cultures from 07/25/2008 showed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.,From the Infectious Disease point of view, the patient has the following problems, and I would recommend following treatments strategy.,1.  Right foot infected ulcer with clinical evidence of osteomyelitis.  Even if the MRI and bone scan are negative, the treatment should be guided with diagnosis on clinical counts in my opinion.  Cultures have been reported positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  Therefore, I would discontinue the current antibiotic regimen of oral Levaquin, Zyvox, and intravenous Zosyn, and start the patient on intravenous Ancef 2 g q.8 h.  We will need to continue this treatment for 6 weeks for treatment of osteomyelitis and deep wound infection.  I would also recommend continuation of wound care and wound VAC placement that would start tomorrow.  We will get a PICC line placed to complete the 6-week course of intravenous antibiotic therapy.,2.  We would check labs including CBC with differential, chemistry 7 panel, LFTs, ESR, and C-reactive protein levels every Monday and chemistry 7 panel and CBC every Thursday for the duration of antibiotic therapy.,3.  I will continue to monitor wound healing 2 to 3 times a week.  Wound care will be managed by the wound care team at the Long-Term Acute Care Facility.,4.

She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.",Neurology

The peak workload was 7 METs.  The resting heart rate was 61 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 173 beats per minute, which was 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with the resting blood pressure 126/86, and the peak blood pressure of 134/90.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm with a right-bundle branch block.  The peak stress EKG was abnormal with 2 mm of ST segment depression in V3 to V6, which remained abnormal till about 6 to 8 minutes into recovery.  There were occasional PVCs, but no sustained arrhythmia.  The patient had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia at peak stress.  The ischemic threshold was at a heart rate of 118 beats per minute and at 4.6 METs.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting images.,MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:,1.  The overall quality of the scan was fair in view of increased abdominal uptake, increased bowel uptake seen.,2.  There was a large area of moderate to reduced tracer concentration seen in the inferior wall and the inferior apex.  This appeared to be partially reversible in the resting images.,3.  The left ventricle appeared normal in size.,4.  Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function with normal wall thickening.  The calculated ejection fraction was 70% at rest.,CONCLUSIONS:,1.  Average exercise tolerance.,2.  Adequate cardiac stress.,3.  Abnormal EKG response to stress, consistent with ischemia.  No symptoms of chest pain at rest.,4.  Myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal with a large-sized, moderate intensity partially reversible inferior wall and inferior apical defect, consistent with inferior wall ischemia and inferior apical ischemia.,5.

The patient subsequently then had a CT scan which demonstrated a very large thyroid gland, especially on the left side with substernal extension down to the level of the aortic arch.  The patient was then immediately set up for surgery.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the patient, a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  The patient was then placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient then had a shoulder roll placed.  After this, the patient then had the area marked initially.  The preoperative setting was then localized with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 10 cc total.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #15 Bard-Parker was then utilized to make a skin incision horizontally, approximately 5 cm on either side from midline.  After this, a blunt dissection was then utilized to dissect the subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle.  There appeared to be a natural dehiscence of the platysma in the midline.  A sub-platysmal dissection was then performed in the superior, inferior, and lateral directions with the help of a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors and DeBakey forceps.  Any bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization.  After this, the two anterior large jugular veins were noted and resected laterally.  The patient's trachea appeared to be slightly deviated to the right with identification finally of the midline raphe, off midline to the right.  This was grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps and dissected with monopolar cauterization and dissected with a Metzenbaum scissors.  After this was dissected, the sternohyoid muscles were resected laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles.  The sternothyroid muscles were then bluntly freed and dissected from the right thyroid gland.  After this, attention was then drawn to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was dissected bluntly on this side utilizing finger dissection and Kitners.  The left thyroid gland was freed initially superiorly and worked inferiorly and laterally until the gland was pulled from the substernal region by blunt dissection and reflected and pulled anteriorly.  After this, the superior and inferior parathyroid glands were noted.  The dissection was carried very close to the thyroid gland to try to select these parathyroids posteriorly.  After this, the superior pole was then identified and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross clamped and tied with __________ undyed Vicryl tie.  The superior pole was finally freed and a small little feeding branched vessels from this area were cauterized with the bipolar cautery and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  After this, the thyroid gland was further freed down to the level of the Berry's ligament inferiorly and the dissection was carried once again more superiorly.  The fine stats were then utilized to dissect along the superior aspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side with freeing of the connective Berry's ligament tissue from the gland with the bipolar cauterization and the fine stat.  Finally, attention was then drawn back to the patient's right side where the gland was rotated more anteriorly with fine dissection utilizing a fine stat to reflect the superior and inferior parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified and further dissection was carried superiorly and anteriorly through this nerve to finally free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties and also bipolared with the bipolar cauterization bilaterally.  The Berry's ligament was then finally freed and the gland was then passed to scrub tech and passed off the field to Pathology.  The neck was then thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  After this, Surgicel was then placed in the bilateral neck regions and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was then placed within the left neck region with some extension over to the right neck region.  This was brought out through the inferior skin incision and secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The skin was then reapproximated with a #5-0 Prolene subcuticular along with a #6-0 fast over the top.  After this, Mastisol Steri-Strips and Bacitracin along with a sterile dressing and a __________ dressing were then placed.  The patient intraoperatively did have approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage from this area within the JP drain.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.

The patient was estimated to be approximately 10-1/2 weeks so long in her pregnancy.  She began to have heavy vaginal bleeding and intense lower pelvic cramping.  She was seen in the emergency room where she was found to be hemodynamically stable.  On pelvic exam, her cervix was noted to be 1 to 2 cm dilated and approximately 90% effaced.  There were bulging membranes protruding through the dilated cervix.  These symptoms were consistent with the patient's prior experience of spontaneous miscarriages.  These findings were reviewed with her and options for treatment discussed.  She elected to proceed with an exam under anesthesia with uterine suction curettage.  The risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and knowing these, she gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where she was placed in the seated position.  A spinal anesthetic was successfully administered.  She was then moved to a dorsal lithotomy position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate spinal level was confirmed, a bimanual exam was again performed.  This revealed the uterus to be anteverted to axial and approximately 10 to 11 weeks in size.  The previously noted cervical exam was confirmed.  The weighted vaginal speculum was then inserted and the vaginal vault flooded with povidone solution.  This solution was then removed approximately 10 minutes later with dry sterile gauze sponge.  The anterior cervical lip was then attached with a ring clamp.  The tissue and membranes protruding through the os were then gently grasped with a ring clamp and traction applied.  The tissue dislodged revealing fluid mixed with blood as well as an apparent 10-week fetus.  The placental tissue was then gently tractioned out as well.  A size 9 curved suction curette was then gently inserted through the dilated os and into the endometrial cavity.  With the vacuum tubing applied in rotary motion, a moderate amount of tissue consistent with products of conception was evacuated.  The sharp curette was then utilized to probe the endometrial surface.  A small amount of additional tissue was then felt in the posterior uterine wall.  This was curetted free.  A second pass was then made with a vacuum curette.  Again, the endometrial cavity was probed with a sharp curette and no significant additional tissue was encountered.  A final pass was then made with a suction curette.,The ring clamp was then removed from the anterior cervical lip.  There was only a small amount of bleeding following the curettage.  The weighted speculum was then removed as well.  The bimanual exam was repeated and good involution was noted.  The patient was taken down from the dorsal lithotomy position.  She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The sponge and instrument count was performed and found to be correct.

The parentsagreed to proceed after all questions were answered.,TECHNIQUE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After general mask anesthesia was adequately obtained, the right external auditory canal was cleaned out under the microscope.  Serous fluid was aspirated from the middle ear space.  An Armstrong grommet tube was placed down through the incision and rotated into place.  The opposite ear was then cleaned out under the microscope.  Serous fluid was aspirated from the middle ear space.  An Armstrong grommet tube was placed down through the incision and rotated into place.  Cortisporin suspension was placed in both ear canals.,Then the patient was intubated.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed into the mouth and extended and hung on the Mayo stand.  The red rubber catheter was placed down through the nose and brought out through the mouth to retract the palate.  The adenoid fossa was visualized with the mirror.  The adenoids were removed using the microdebrider.  Two adenoid packs were placed.  The packs were removed one by one.  Using mirror and suction bovie, adequate hemostasis was achieved.,The tonsils were quite large and cryptic.  The tenaculum was placed on the superior pole of the right tonsil.  Cheesy material came out from the crypts.  The tonsils were retracted medially.  The bovie electrocautery was used to make an incision in the right anterior tonsillar pillar, and the plane was developed between the tonsil and the musculature.  The tonsil was completely dissected out of this plane, preserving both the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars.  All bleeders were cauterized as they were encountered.  The tenaculum was then placed on the superior pole of the left tonsil.  Cheesy material came out from the crypts.  The tonsils were retracted medially.  The bovie electrocautery was used to make an incision in the left anterior tonsillar pillar, and the plane was developed between the tonsil and the musculature.

3135,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Metastatic ovarian cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic.  She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.,At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,1.

2667,"PROCEDURE:,  Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve.  Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve.  Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected.,Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized.  Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly.,The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.  The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass.  Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.,A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures.  Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound.  The elbow was dressed and splinted.  The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",Neurosurgery

There is no calcific or non-calcific plaque. The vessel bifurcates into a left anterior descending artery and a left circumflex artery.,LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY:,The left anterior descending artery is a moderate-sized vessel, with a small first diagonal branch and a large second diagonal branch. The vessel continues as a small vessel, tapering at the apex of the left ventricle. There is calcific plaque within the mid vessel, with dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the second diagonal branch. This limits evaluation of the vessel lumen, and although a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded, there is no evidence of a high-grade stenosis. There is ostial calcification within the second diagonal branch as well. The LAD distal to the second diagonal branch is small relative to the more proximal vessel, and this is worrisome for a proximal flow-limiting lesion.,In addition, there is marked tapering of the D2 branch distal to the proximal and ostial calcific plaque. This is worrisome for either occlusion or a high-grade stenosis. There is only minimal contrast that is identified in the distal vessel.,LEFT CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY:,The left circumflex artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium. There is calcific plaque within the proximal vessel. There is dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the OM1, and the AV groove branch. The AV groove branch tapers as a small vessel at the base of the heart. The dense calcific plaque within the bifurcation of the OM1 and the AV groove branch limits evaluation of the vessel lumen. There is no demonstrated high-grade stenosis, but a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here.,RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:,The right coronary artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium. There is proximal mixed calcific and non-calcific plaque, but there is no flow-limiting lesion. The vessel continues as a moderate-sized vessel to the crux of the heart, supplying a small posterior descending artery and moderate to large posterolateral ventricular branches.,There is scattered calcific plaque within the mid vessel and there is also calcific plaque within the distal vessel at the origin of the posterior descending artery. There is no flow-limited lesion demonstrated.,The right coronary artery is dominant.,NONCORONARY CARDIAC STRUCTURE:,CARDIAC CHAMBERS:, There is diffuse myocardial thinning within the left ventricle, particularly within the apex where there is subendocardial calcification, consistent with chronic infarction. There is ventricular enlargement. There is no demonstrated aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.,CARDIAC VALVES: ,There is calcification within the left aortic valve cusp. The aortic valve is tri-leaflet.

End-stage liver disease.,HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted after undergoing a drawn out process with a small bowel obstruction.  His bowel function started to improve.  He was on TPN prior to coming to Hospital.  He has remained on TPN throughout his time here, but his appetite and his p.o. intake have improved some.  The patient had an episode while here where his blood pressure bottomed out requiring him to spend multiple days in the Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.  At one point, we were unsuccessful at weaning him off the dopamine, but after approximately 11 days, he finally started to tolerate weaning parameters, was successfully removed from dopamine, and has maintained his blood pressure without difficulty.  The patient also was requiring BiPAP to help with his oxygenation and it appeared that he developed a left-sided pneumonia.  This has been treated successfully with Zyvox and Levaquin and Diflucan.  He seems to be currently doing much better.  He is only using BiPAP in the evening.  As stated above, he is eating better.  He had some evidence of redness and exquisite swelling around his genital and lower abdominal region.  This may be mainly dependent edema versus anasarca.  The patient has been diuresed aggressively over the last 4 to 5 days, and this seems to have made some improvement in his swelling.  This morning, the patient denies any acute distress.  He states he is feeling good and understands that he is being discharged to another facility for continued care and rehabilitation.  He will be discharged to Garden Court skilled nursing facility.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS/INSTRUCTIONS:,  He is going to be going with Protonix 40 mg daily, metoclopramide 10 mg every 6 hours, Zyvox 600 mg daily for 5 days, Diflucan 150 mg p.o. daily for 3 days, Bumex 2 mg p.o. daily, Megace 400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Ensure 1 can t.i.d. with meals, and MiraLax 17 gm p.o. daily.  The patient is going to require physical therapy to help with assistance in strength training.  He is also going to need respiratory care to work with his BiPAP.  His initial settings are at a rate of 20, pressure support of 12, PEEP of 6, FIO2 of 40%.  The patient will need a sleep study, which the nursing home will be able to set up.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On the day of discharge, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 102/59, temperature 98.2, O2 sat 97%.,GENERAL:  A well-developed white male who appears in no apparent distress.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Positive S1, S2 without murmur, rubs, or gallops.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.,ABDOMEN:  Positive for bowel sounds.  Soft, nondistended.  He does have some generalized redness around his abdominal region and groin.  This does appear improved compared to presentation last week.  The swelling in this area also appears improved.,EXTREMITIES:  Show no clubbing or cyanosis.  He does have some lower extremity edema, 2+ distal pedal pulses are present.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and oriented to person and place.  He is alert and aware of surroundings.  We have not had any difficulties with confusion here lately.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient moves all extremities without difficulty.  He is just weak in general.,LABORATORY DATA: , Lab work done today shows the following:  White count 4.2, hemoglobin 10.2, hematocrit 30.6, and platelet count 184,000.  Electrolytes show sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride 98, CO2 26, glucose 79, BUN 56, and creatinine 1.4.  Calcium 8.8, phosphorus is a little high at 5.5, magnesium 2.2, albumin 3.9.,PLAN:  ,Discharge this gentleman from Hospital and admit him to Garden Court SNF where they can continue with his rehab and conditioning.  Hopefully, long-term planning will be discharge home.  He has a history of end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis, which may make him a candidate for hospice upon discharge.  The family initially wanted to bring the patient home, but he is too weak and requires too much assistance to adequately consider this option at this time.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
2793,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.,She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: , Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only ""comes and goes."",TASKS ADMINISTERED:,Clinical Interview,Adult History Questionnaire,Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination,Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX),Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2),Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III),Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV),Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI),Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA),Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT),Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT),Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test,Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II),  Token Test,  Sentence Repetition,  Visual Naming,  Controlled Oral Word Association,  Spelling Test,  Aural Comprehension,  Reading Comprehension,Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2),Animal Naming Test",Neurology

Also, 0.5 mL dexamethasone phosphate (4 mg/mL).,INDICATIONS: , Please see dictated H&P for specifics.,PROCEDURE:  ,After proper identification was made, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the table in supine position.  The patient was then placed under general anesthesia.  A local block was then injected into the third ray of the left foot.  The left foot was then prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate and then draped in the usual sterile technique.  The left foot was then exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and elevated and an ankle pneumatic tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed to the third interspace where a longitudinal incision was placed just proximal to the webspace.  The incision was deepened via sharp and blunt dissection with care taken to protect all vital structures.  Identification of the neuroma was made following plantar flexion of the digits.  It was grasped with a hemostat and it was dissected in toto and removed.  It was then sent to pathology.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Closure was with 4-0 Vicryl in the subcutaneous tissue and then running subcuticular 4-0 nylon suture in the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over that area.  A sterile compressive dressing consisting of saline-soaked gauze, ABD, Kling, Coban was placed over the foot.  The tourniquet was then released.  Good flow was noted to return to all digits.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well.  He left the operating room with all vital signs stable and neurovascular status intact.  The patient went to the recovery.  The patient previously had been given both oral and written preoperative as well as postoperative instructions and a prescription for pain.  The patient will follow up with me in approximately 4 days for dressing change.",Surgery
4863,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 4-month-old who presented with respiratory distress and absent femoral pulses with subsequent evaluation including echocardiogram that demonstrated severe coarctation of the aorta with a peak gradient of 29 mmHg and associated dilated cardiomyopathy with fractional shortening of 16%.  A bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta.,PROCEDURE:  ,After sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a percutaneous technique a 4-French 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place.  There was good blood return from both the ports.,Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.,Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ,ascending aorta and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  The transverse arch measured 5 mm.  Isthmus measured 4.7 mm and coarctation measured 2.9 x 1.8 mm at the descending aorta level.  The diaphragm measured 5.6 mm.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter, which was then directed into the right innominate artery.  This catheter was exchanged over a wire for a Tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist.  Pressure pull-back following angioplasty, however, demonstrated a residual of 15-20 mmHg gradient.  Repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing.  The angioplasty was then performed using a Tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist.  The pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull-back measurement and final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia.  There is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt.  Further the heart was desaturated due to VQ mismatch.,Phasic right-sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmHg systolic gradient on pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated flows were mildly increased.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels.  There is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.  Flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde.  Following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta, there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmHg to 92 mmHg.  There remained a 4 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated systemic flow fell to normal values.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus.  There is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries.  The narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4.9 x 4.2 mm.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.,2.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.,3.  Bicuspid aortic valve.,4.  Patent foramen ovale.,INTERVENTION: , Balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta.,MANAGEMENT: , The case will be discussed at combined Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference.  The patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery.  The patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4-6 months.  The further cardiologic care will be directed by Dr. X.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
2720,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Metopic synostosis with trigonocephaly.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Metopic synostosis with trigonocephaly.,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  Bilateral orbital frontal zygomatic craniotomy (skull base approach).,2.  Bilateral orbital advancement with (C-shaped osteotomies down to the inferior orbital rim) with bilateral orbital advancement with bone grafts.,3.  Bilateral forehead reconstruction with autologous graft.,4.  Advancement of the temporalis muscle bilaterally.,5.  Barrel-stave osteotomies of the parietal bones.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with a roll under his shoulders and his head resting on a foam doughnut.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped with ChloraPrep.  Incision was infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and he received antibiotics and he was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A bicoronal zigzag incision was made and Raney clips used for hemostasis.  Subcutaneous flaps were developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  These were subgaleal flaps.  Bipolar and Bovie cautery were used for hemostasis.  The craniectomy was outlined with methylene blue.  The pericranium was incised exposing the bone along the outline of the craniotomy.,Paired bur holes were drilled anteriorly and posteriorly straddling the metopic suture.  One was just above the nasion and the other was near the bregma.  Also bilateral pterional bur holes were drilled.  There was a little bit of bleeding from a tributary of the sagittal sinus anteriorly and so bone wax was used for hemostasis in all the bur holes.,The dura was separated with a #4 Penfield dissector and then the craniotomies were fashioned or cut.  I should say with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit and the footplate attachment, the bilateral craniotomies were cut and then the midline piece was elevated separately.  Great care was taken when removing the bone from the midline.  Bipolar cautery was used for bleeding points on the dura and especially over the sagittal sinus and the bleeding was controlled.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,The next step was to perform the orbital osteotomies with careful protection of the orbital contents.  Osteotomies were made with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit in the orbital roof bilaterally.  This was a very thick and vertically oriented orbital roof on each side.  Midas Rex drill and osteotomes and mallet were used to cut these osteotomies using retractors to protect the orbital contents and the dura.  The osteotomies were carried down through the tripod of the orbit and down through the lateral orbital rim and all the way down to the inferior orbital rim using the osteotome and mallet.  Bone wax was used for hemostasis.  It was necessary to score the undersurface of the bone at the midline because it was so thick and pointed.  So we were not going to be able to effect the orbital advancement without scoring the bone and thinning it out a bit.  This was done with the Midas Rex drill using B5 bit.  Also, the marked ridge just above the nasion was burred down with the Midas Rex drill.  The osteotomies were also carried down through the zygoma.  At this point, with a gentle rocking motion and sustained pressure using the osteotomes, it was then possible to carefully advance the orbital rims bilaterally, first on the right and then on the left again using just a careful rocking motion against the remaining bone to gently bend the orbital rims outward bilaterally.,Dr. X cut the bone grafts from the bone flaps and I fashioned a shelf to secure the bone graft by burring a ledge on the internal surface of the superior orbital rim.  This created a shelf for the notched bone graft to lean against basically anteriorly.  The posterior notch of the bone graft was able to be braced by the ledge of orbital roof posteriorly.,The left medial orbital rim greenstick fractured a bit, but the bone graft appeared to stay in place.,Holes were then cut in the supraorbital rim for advancement of the temporalis muscle and then a Synthes mesh was placed anteriorly using absorbable screw hardware and attached the mesh where the forehead bone flaps turned around and recontoured to make a nice bilateral forehead for Isaac.,At this point the undersurface of the temporalis muscle was scored using the Bovie cautery to allow advancement of the muscle anteriorly and we sutured it to the supraorbital rims bilaterally with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  This helped fill-in the indentation left by the orbital advancement at the temporal region.,Also, I separated the undersurface of the dura from the bone bilaterally and cut multiple barrel-stave osteotomies in the parietal bones and then greenstick fractured these barrel-staves outward to create a more normal contour of the bone slightly posteriorly.,At this point, Gelfoam had been used to protect the dura over the sagittal sinus during this part of the procedure.,The wound was then irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  Bleeding had been controlled during the procedure with Bovie and bipolar electrocautery, even so the blood loss was fairly significant adding up to about 300 or 400 mL and he received that much in packed cells and he also received a unit of fresh frozen plasma.,At this point, the reconstruction looked good.  The advancement was about 1 cm and we were pleased with the results.  The wound was irrigated and then the Gelfoam over the midline dura was left in place and the galea was then closed with #4-0 and some #3-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and #5-0 mild chromic on the skin.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Again, blood loss was bout 300 to 400 mL and he received 2 units of blood and some fresh frozen plasma.",Neurosurgery

I explained fully the procedure to the patient.,PROCEDURE: , Both sides were done exactly the same way.  After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery.  The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides.  Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult.  The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm.  They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled.  The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond.  She tolerated the procedure well.",Neurosurgery

4558,"HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke.  The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,STUDY: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.,To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE: , The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.,The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: , The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.,PLAN:,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.,3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.,4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.,Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety.",Consult - History and Phy.

1636,"ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT),The patient is to undergo a course of angioplasty for in-stent restenosis.  The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site.  After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter.  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy.  The does per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter.  Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.",Radiology
2083,"Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice.  For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient.  The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire.  To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998.  At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck.  The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer.  He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember.  He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005.  At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles.  Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital.  He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2.  This was done on 12/15/2005.  Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot.  He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg.  The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily.  The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required.  He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal.  The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center.  At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression.  There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors.  It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications.  Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes.  Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations.  He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes.  The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis.  This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist.  It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking.  Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs.  Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings.  His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls.  It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time.  In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program.  The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record.  Evaluation was done by Dr. B.  At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco.  These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks.  The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain.  He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited.  He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while.  ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero.  The patient denies smoking at this time.  He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use.  He obtains no pain medications from no other sources.  Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly.  There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes.  CABG in July of 2006 with no preoperative angina, shortness of breath, or myocardial infarction.  History of depression, lumbar fusion surgery in 2000, left knee surgery 25 years ago.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  The patient is on disability.  He does not smoke.  He does not drink alcohol.  He is single.  He lives with a girlfriend.  He has minimal activities of daily living.  The patient cannot recollect when last a urine drug screen was done.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  No fevers, no headaches, chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, or change in appetite.  Depressive symptoms of crying and decreased self-worth have been noted in the past.  No neurological history of strokes, epileptic seizures.  Genitourinary negative.  Gastrointestinal negative.  Integumentary negative.  Behavioral, depression.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is short of hearing.  His cognitive skills appear to be significantly impaired.  The patient is oriented x3 to time and place.  Weight 185 pounds, temperature 97.5, blood pressure 137/92, pulse 61.  The patient is complaining of pain of a 9/10.,Musculoskeletal:  The patient's gait is markedly antalgic with predominant weightbearing on the left leg.  There is marked postural deviation to the left.  Because of pain, the patient is unable to heel-toe or tandem gait.  Examination of the neck and cervical spine are within normal limits.  Range of motion of the elbow, shoulders are within normal limits.  No muscle spasm or abnormal muscle movements noted in the neck and upper extremities.  Head is normocephalic.  Examination of the anterior neck is within normal limits.  There is significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the left, as well as of the calf muscles.  Skin is normal.  Hair distribution normal.  Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities.  The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened.  There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1.  The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles.  Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right.  Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions.  It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5  in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem.  There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left.  No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted.  Patrick's test is negative bilaterally.  There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area.  Neurological exam:  Cranial nerves II through XII are within normal limits.  Neurological exam of the upper extremities is within normal limits with good motor strength and normal biceps, triceps and brachioradialis reflexes.  Neurological exam of the lower extremities shows a 2+ right patellar reflex and -1 on the left.  There is no ankle clonus.  Babinski is negative.  Sensory testing shows a minimal degree of sensory loss on the right L5 distribution.  Muscle testing shows decreased L4-L5 on the left with extensor hallucis longus +2/5.

Severe cognitive impairment with minimal ***** for rehabilitation or return to work.,4.  Opioid dependence for pain control.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  The patient will continue on with his medications prescribed by Dr. Chang and I will see him in two weeks' time and probably suggest switching over from OxyContin to methadone.  I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment.  I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy.  The prognosis here for any improvement or return to work is zero.",Orthopedic
1761,"REFERRAL QUESTIONS:,  Mr. Abcd was referred for psychological assessment by his primary medical provider, to help clarify his diagnosis, especially with respect to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a depression, or a Bipolar Spectrum Disorder.  The information will be used for treatment planning.,BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Mr. Abcd is a 33-year-old married man who lives with his wife and three children.  He has been married since 1995 and lost a son to SIDS over seven years ago.  He served in the army for two years, and did attend some college at UAA.  He still wants to get a degree in engineering.  Mr. Abcd indicated that he did use THC at the time of his initial intake with me in January 2006, but there are no other substance abuse issues as an adult so far as I am aware.  He has had multiple stressors, including a bankruptcy in 2000, as well as his wife's significant health problems.  He also reported having herniated discs incurred in an injury over a year ago.  He has received counseling in the past, and did try both Lexapro and Wellbutrin, which he stopped taking in October 2005.  He indicated these medications tended to decrease libido and flatten all of his emotions.  He indicated that he thought he might have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but that this had not been formally evaluated or treated.  There is no reported bipolar illness in his immediate family, but there is some depression.  A recent stressor involved OCS involvement, apparently because his infant child tested positive for THC.  So far as I am aware, this case is closed at this time.  ,BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:,  Mr. Abcd arrived on time for his testing session dressed casually and with good hygiene and grooming.  Mood is reported to be generally okay, though with some stress.  Affect was bright and appropriate to the situation.  Speech was a little pressured, but was of normal content and was at all times coherent and goal directed.  He was a very pleasant and cooperative testing subject, who appeared to give a good effort on the tasks requested of him.  The results appear to provide a useful sample of his current attitudes, opinions, and functional levels in the areas assessed.,ASSESSMENT RESULTS:,  Mr. Abcd's responses to a brief self-report instrument given to him by Dr. Starks was suggestive of symptoms that could be consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  I therefore had him complete the Conners CPT-II, which showed good performance and no indications of attention problems.  The Confidence Index associated with ADHD was over 58 percent that no clinical attention problems are present.  While a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should not unequivocally be ruled out based on the results of this test, there is nothing in the CPT-II measures indicating attention problems, and that diagnosis appears to be unlikely.  The MMPI-2 profile is a technically valid and interpretable one.  The Modified Welsh Code is as follows:  49+86-231/570:  F'+-/:LK#.  The high F scale may reflect some moodiness, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and changeableness in his typical behavior.  The Basic Clinical Profile is similar to persons who tend to get into trouble for violating social norms and rules.  Such persons are more likely to experience conflicts with authority.  They also are prone to impulsivity, self-indulgence, problems with delay of gratification, exercise problematic judgment, and often have low frustration tolerance.  Those with similar scores tend to be moody, irritable, extraverted, and often do not trust others very much.  Mr. Abcd may tend to keep others at a distance, yet feel rather insecure and dependent.  A bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and an antisocial personality disorder cannot be entirely ruled out either, though I am less confident that that is correct.  The MMPI-2 Content Scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and the Supplementary Scales has a single clinical elevation on Addiction Admission, which is entirely consistent with his interview data.  Posttraumatic stress scales are not elevated at a clear clinical level on the MMPI-2.,SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS:,",Psychiatry / Psychology
1835,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right hallux abductovalgus deformity.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right hallux abductovalgus deformity.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Right McBride bunionectomy.,2.  Right basilar wedge osteotomy with OrthoPro screw fixation.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with IV sedation.,HEMOSTASIS: , With pneumatic ankle cuff.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner.  Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure.  The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection.  Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp.  At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection.  Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments.  The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment.  At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete.  The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw.  The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted.  At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption.  At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint.  At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge.  The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm.  The screw was placed following proper technique.  The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing.  A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy.  The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed.  At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion.  The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site.  At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily.  The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion.  The tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal.  The patient tolerated the anesthesia and the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.,The patient has been given written and verbal postoperative instructions and has been instructed to call if she has any questions, problems, or concerns at any time with the numbers provided.  The patient has also been warned a number of times the importance of elevation and no weightbearing on the surgical foot.,",Podiatry

She has had fairly normal lipid panel, last being checked on 11/26/2003.  Cholesterol was 194, triglycerides 118, HDL 41, and LDL 129.  The patient is a nonsmoker.  Her fasting glucose in November 2003 was within normal limits at 94.  Her fasting insulin level was normal.  Repeat nonfasting glucose was 109 on 06/22/2004.  She does not have history of diabetes.  She does not exercise regularly and is not able to because of knee pain.  She also has had difficulties with low back pain.  X-ray of the low back did show a mild compression fracture of L1.  She has had no falls that would contribute to a compression fracture.  She has had a normal DEXA scan on 11/07/2003 that does not really correlate with having a compression fracture of the lumbar spine; however, it is possible that arthritis could contribute to falsely high bone density reading on DEXA scan.  She is wanting to consider treatment for prevention of further compression fractures and possible osteoporosis.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg a day, Prozac 20 mg a day, Vioxx 25 mg a day, vitamin C 250 mg daily, vitamin E three to four tablets daily, calcium with D 1500 mg daily, multivitamin daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, Monopril 40 mg daily, Celexa p.r.n.,ALLERGIES:  ,Bactrim, which causes nausea and vomiting, and adhesive tape.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.

Then it was let down for approximately 15 minutes and then reinflated for another 26 minutes for a total of 149 minutes.,COMPONENTS: , A Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee size D right stemmed femoral component was used.  A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm.  A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm was used.  A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface was used as well.  Original patellar component that the patient had was maintained.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years.  She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility.  She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position.  Care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position.  Once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh.  At this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum.  A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface.  There was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well.  At this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed.  This was done without difficulty.  Attention was then directed removing the femoral component.  Osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed.  After this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component.  An osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose.  There was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation.  This was evaluated.  The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component.  The attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component.  At this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut.  We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut.  We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12.  At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed.  Care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis.  Once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made.  This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally.  The anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide.  The anterior surface cutting block was then placed.  This aligned us to anterior cutting block.,We ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis.  Once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made.  It was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface.  _______ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on.  This allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur.  Once this was placed and pinned in position.  Care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut.  It was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone.  The posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects.  This was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component.  After all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed.  This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position.  It appeared to be satisfactory.  At this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ was obtained.  At this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut.  This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface.  The cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component.  At this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone.  This was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component.  This was placed in a proper position.  A 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position.  We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut.  The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis.  At this point, all trials were removed.  The patella was then examined.  The rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium.  The patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone.  It was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed.  At this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed.  There was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes.  These were removed with a rongeur.,At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried.  The tourniquet was then reinflated.  The canals were prepped for cementing.  They were suction-dried and cleaned.  The tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial.  Once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component.  The stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented.  Again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation.  A size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression.  This was then taken through extension and held until cement cured.  This was then removed and the components were evaluated.  All excess cement was removed and they were well fixed.  Size 14 mm trial Poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability.  It was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly.  This gave us extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion.  The final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured.  The knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion.  The patella was tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned.  At this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All bleeding was cauterized using a Bovie cautery.  The retinaculum was then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion.  This was reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl.  The knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  A drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage.  At this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was approximated with skin clips.  Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed.  A large Dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity.  The patient was then transferred back to recovery in supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.",Orthopedic

The patient last underwent a right frontal ventricular peritoneal shunt on 10/12/07.  This resulted in relief of left chest pain, but the patient continued to complaint of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow.  She was seen in clinic on 12/11/07 during which time MRI of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear.  She did have a previous MRI of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left C6-C7 level.  Based on this, negative MRI of the shoulder, the patient was recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C6-C7 level.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with her.  Risks include, but not exclusive of bleeding and infection, bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremities as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this occur, the patient understands that she needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk of infection, which can be superficial and can be managed with p.o. antibiotics.  However, the patient may develop deeper-seated infection, which may require return to the operating room.  Should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation, this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation and/or allograft.  There is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus, the trachea, and the carotid artery.  There is also the risks of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid.  There is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and hardware failure.  She understood all of these risks and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics and this revealed normal findings, which remained normal during the entire case.  The EMGs were silent and there was no evidence of any stimulation.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension.  The head was supported on a foam doughnut.  The right cervical area was then exposed by turning the head about 45 to 60 degrees to the left side.  A linear incision was made about two to three fingerbreadths from the suprasternal notch along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to a distance of about 3 cm.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, the incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to carry the dissection down to the platysma in the similar fashion as the skin incision.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified as well as the sternohyoid/omohyoid muscles.  Dissection was then carried lateral and superior to the omohyoid muscle and lateral to the esophagus and the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified and cut sharply.  A localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 interspace.  Proceeded to the strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C6 and C7.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  The annulus was then cut in a quadrangular fashion and piecemeal removal of the dura was done using a straight pituitary rongeurs, 3 and 5 mm burr.  The interior endplate of C6 and superior endplate of C7 was likewise was drilled down together with posteroinferior edge of C6 and the posterior superior edge of C7.  There was note of a new osteophyte on the left C6-C7 foramen.  This was carefully drilled down.  After decompression and removal of pressure, there was noted to be release of the epidural space with no significant venous bleeders.  They were controlled with slight bipolar coagulation, temporary tamponade with Gelfoam.  After this was completed, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant was then tapped into placed after its interior was packed with Vitoss.  The plate was then applied and secured in place with four 12 x 4.7 mm screws.  Irrigation of the area was done.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid out over the graft and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures as well as Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis.  The wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with nylon 3-0 stitch and dressing was applied only at the exit site.  C-collar was placed and the patient was transferred to Recovery after extubation.",Surgery
1090,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Critical left carotid stenosis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Critical left carotid stenosis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Left carotid endarterectomy with endovascular patch angioplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  Cervical block.,GROSS FINDINGS:  ,The patient is a 57-year-old black female with chronic renal failure.  She does have known critical carotid artery stenosis.  She wishes to undergo bilateral carotid endarterectomy, however, it was felt necessary by Dr. X to perform cardiac catheterization.  She was admitted to the hospital yesterday with chest pain.  She has been considered for coronary artery bypass grafting.  I have been asked to address the carotid stenosis, left being more severe, this was addressed first.  Intraoperatively, an atherosclerotic plaque was noted in the common carotid artery extending into the internal carotid artery.  The internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  The external carotid artery was occluded at its origin.  When the endarterectomy was performed, the external carotid artery back-bled nicely.  The internal carotid artery had good backflow bleeding noted.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite and placed in the supine position.  Then neck, shoulder, and chest wall were prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  Longitudinal incision was created along the anterior border of the left sternocleidal mastoid muscle and this was taken through the subcutaneous tissue and platysmal muscle utilizing electrocautery.,Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections, the common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery beyond the atherosclerotic back, the external carotid artery, and the superior thyroid artery were isolated and encircled with a umbilical tape.  During the dissection, facial veins were ligated with #4-0 silk ligature prior to dividing them.  Also during the dissection, ansa cervicalis, hypoglossal, and vagus nerve identified and preserved.  There was some inflammation above the carotid bulb, but this was not problematic.,The patient had been administered 5000 units of aqueous heparin after allowing adequate circulating time.  The internal carotid artery is controlled with Heifitz clip followed by the external carotid artery and the superior thyroid artery being controlled with Heifitz clips.  The common carotid artery was controlled with profunda clamp.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  A longitudinal arteriotomy was created along the posterior lateral border of the common carotid artery.  This was extended across the lobe on to the internal carotid artery.  An endarterectomy was then performed.  The ________ intima was cleared of all debris and the ________ was flushed with copious amounts of heparinized saline.  As mentioned before, the internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  This was shortened by imbricating the internal carotid artery with horizontal mattress stitches of #7-0 Prolene suture.,The wound was copiously irrigated, rather an endovascular patch was then brought on to the field.  This was cut to shape and length.  This was sutured in place with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  The suture line began at both sites.  The suture was tied in the center along the anterior and posterior walls.  Prior to completing the closure, the common carotid artery was flushed.  The internal carotid artery permitted to back bleed.  The clamp was placed after completing the closure.  The clamp was placed at the origin of the internal carotid artery.  Flow was first directed into the external carotid artery then into the internal carotid artery.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  Topical ________ Gelfoam was utilized.  Of note, during the endarterectomy, the patient did receive an additional 7000 units of aqueous heparin.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needle, and all counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable suture.  Stainless steel staples approximated skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, grossly neurologically intact.",Surgery
4543,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes.  The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",Consult - History and Phy.

603,"OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.",Surgery

She denies hallucinations, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation at this time.  States that she does not want surgery because the chest pain that was a presenting complaint has gone away that she did not feel her problem is severe enough to require surgery, and medical records does show in this obese individual that cardiac surgery would present substantial risks and for this individual with the chronic mental illness and behavioral problems of a chronic nature, surgery does present some additional risks.  The patient notes that she has a long history of substance abuse, primarily inhalation of paint vapors that she had more than 100 incarcerations in the XYZ County Jail related to offenses related to her lifestyle at that time such as shoplifting, violation of orders to abstain from substance abuse and the longest confinement of these was 100 days.,The patient is able to write a fairly reasonable explanation for why she does not want to pursue medical care.,PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: , She was born in XYZ.

Microdissection and micro-magnification for resection of brain tumor.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of left-sided weakness and headaches.  She has a previous history of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, treated 2 years ago.  An MRI was obtained which showed a large enhancing mass in the medial right frontal lobe consistent with a metastatic lesion or possible primary brain tumor.  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room for surgery.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Medial right frontal brain tumor with surrounding edema and mass effect and right to left brain shift, probable metastatic lung carcinoma.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled into the operating room and satisfactory general anesthesia was obtained via endotracheal tube.  She was positioned on the operating room table in the Sugita frame with the head secured.,Using the preoperative image-guided MRI, we carefully registered the fiducials and then obtained the stereotactic image-guided localization to guide us towards the tumor.  We marked external landmarks.  Then we shaved the head over the right medial frontal area.  This area was then sterilely prepped and draped.,Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted.,A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline.  This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips.  The skin flap was retracted medially.  Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected.  One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap.  Hemostasis was obtained.  Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was.  The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus.  We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain.  The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor.,We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins.,Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor.  Subsequently, we entered the tumor.  The tumor itself was extremely hard.  Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma.,We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins.,Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case.  We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally.,Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor.  Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely.  In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out.  We resected the entire tumor.  Neuronavigation was used to confirm that no further tumor residual was remained.,Hemostasis was obtained using bipolar coagulation and Gelfoam.  We also lined the cavity with Surgicel.  The cavity was nicely dry and excellent hemostasis was obtained.,The dura was closed using multiple interrupted 4-0 Nurolon sutures in a watertight fashion.  Surgicel was placed over the dural closure.  The bone flap was repositioned and held in place using CranioFIX cranial fixators.  The galea was re-approximated and the skin was closed with staples.  The wound was dressed.  The patient was returned to the intensive care unit.  She was awake and moving extremities well.  No apparent complications were noted.  Needle and sponge counts were listed as correct at the end of the procedure.  Estimated intraoperative blood loss was approximately 150 mL and none was replaced.",Neurology

Repair of periumbilical hernia.,ANESTHESIA: , General with endotracheal intubation.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.,SPECIMEN: , Hernia sac.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 98-year-old female who presents from nursing home extended care facility with an incarcerated umbilical hernia, intractable nausea and vomiting and a bowel obstruction.  Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia.  There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac.  It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis.  It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was then carried down to the fascia.  Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia.  The abdomen was entered under direct visualization.  The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis.  The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors.  The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen.  Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities.  The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid.  The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction.  Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed.  The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture.  A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.",Surgery

Intraoperative cholangiogram.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general endotracheal anesthetic.  The patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef intravenously piggyback.  The abdomen was prepared and draped in routine sterile fashion.,A 1-cm incision was made at the umbilicus and a Veress needle was inserted.  Saline test was performed.  Satisfactory pneumoperitoneum was achieved by insufflation of CO2 to a pressure of 14 mmHg.  The Veress needle was removed.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted.  Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a gallbladder that was soft and without adhesions to it.  It was largely mobile.  The liver had a normal appearance as did the peritoneal cavity.  A 5-mm cannula was inserted in the right upper quadrant anterior axillary line.  A second 5-mm cannula was inserted in the subcostal space.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted into the upper midline.,The gallbladder was reflected in a cephalad direction.  The gallbladder was punctured with the aspirating needle, and under C-arm fluoroscopy was filled with contrast, filling the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees, which appeared normal.  Extra contrast was aspirated and the aspirating needle was removed.  The ampulla was grasped with a second grasper, opening the triangle of Calot.  The cystic duct was dissected and exposed at its junction with the ampulla, was controlled with a hemoclip, digitally controlled with two clips and divided.  This was done while the common duct was in full visualization.  The cystic artery was similarly controlled and divided.  The gallbladder was dissected from its bed and separated from the liver, brought to the outside through the upper midline cannula and removed.,The subhepatic and subphrenic spaces were irrigated thoroughly with saline solution.  There was oozing and bleeding from the lateral 5-mm cannula site, but this stopped spontaneously with removal of the cannula.  The subphrenic and subhepatic spaces were again irrigated thoroughly with saline until clear.  Hemostasis was excellent.  CO2 was evacuated and the camera removed.  The umbilical fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, the subcu with 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4-0 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.",Gastroenterology

She currently is trach dependent for her airway because of glottic and subglottic stenosis, but she is having no significant problems breathing and talking around her trach tube and came for further evaluation.  Endoscopic reevaluation of her tube and nature of the proposed procedure done.  Risk and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of with speech or swallowing, failure to improve her airway, and loss of voice.  Cardiorespiratory anesthetic results were discussed in length.  The patient states she understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's #5 metal tracheostomy tube was removed and a #5 laser-safe endotracheal tube was inserted.  The patient was then prepared for endoscopy.  The Kantor laryngoscope was then inserted.  Oral cavity, hypopharynx, larynx, and nasal cavity showed good dentition with good tongue, buccal cavity, and mucosa without lesions.  Larynx was then ***** short epiglottis.  Larynx was suspended with significant scarring beginning in the supraglottic area with loss of laryngeal contour beginning in the supraglottis with extensive scar tissue at the level of the false cord obliteration of ventricles and true cords.  This appeared to be stable, and airway was patent at the supraglottic and glottic level with some narrowing at the subglottic level with mild-to-moderate subglottic stenosis, otherwise this appeared to be stable.  However, distally, the level of the trach site examined with the microscope and 0 and 30-degree telescopes.  The patient noted to have marked narrowing with dense scarring posterolaterally on the left securing good visualization of the trach tube.  The laryngoscope was removed, and a 5 x 30 pediatric rigid bronchoscope was then passed.  The LP contact tip laser was utilized to vaporize the scar tissue and release the scar banding following which the scope was passed and further dilation carried out.  Mid and distal trachea were widely patent.  Trachea and mainstem bronchi were patent without obvious disease.  The patient did not appear to have any relapsing polychondritis with progressive scar tissue at the level of the trach site and the posterior trachea wall was significant.  This was further dilated and following which was removed and a new #5 metal tracheostomy tube inserted.

2365,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Achilles ruptured tendon.,HISTORY:,  Mr. XYZ is 41 years of age, who works for Chevron and lives in Angola.  He was playing basketball in Angola back last Wednesday, Month DD, YYYY, when he was driving toward the basket and felt a pop in his posterior leg.  He was seen locally and diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture.  He has been on crutches and has been nonweightbearing since that time.  He had no pain prior to his injury.  He has had some swelling that is mild.  He has just been on aspirin a day due to his traveling time.  Pain currently is minimal.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Denies diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or pulmonary disease.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Malarone, which is an anti-malarial.,ALLERGIES:,  NKDA,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He is a petroleum engineer for Chevron.  Drinks socially.  Does not use tobacco.,PHYSICAL EXAM:,  Pleasant gentleman in no acute distress.  He has some mild swelling on the right ankle and hindfoot.  He has motion that is increased into dorsiflexion.  He has good plantarflexion.  Good subtalar, Chopart and forefoot motion.  His motor function is intact although weak into plantarflexion.  Sensation is intact.  Pulses are strong.  In the prone position, he has diminished tension on the affected side.  There is some bruising around the posterior heel.  He has a palpable defect about 6-8 cm proximal to the insertion site that is tender for him.  Squeezing the calf causes no plantarflexion of the foot.,RADIOGRAPHS:,  Of his right ankle today show a preserved joint space.  I don't see any evidence of fracture noted.  Radiographs of the heel show no fracture noted with good alignment.,IMPRESSION:,  Right Achilles tendon rupture.,PLAN:,  I have gone over with Mr. XYZ the options available.  We have discussed the risks, benefits and alternatives to operative versus nonoperative treatment.  Based on his age and his activity level, I think his best option is for operative fixation.  We went over the risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, rerupture of the tendon, weakness and the need for future surgery.  We have discussed doing this as an outpatient procedure.  He would be nonweightbearing in a splint for 10 days, nonweightbearing in a dynamic brace for 4 weeks, and then a walking boot for another six weeks with a lift until three months postop when we can get him into a shoe with a ¼"" lift.  He understands a 6-9 month return to sports overall.  He will also need to be on some Lovenox for a week after surgery and then on an aspirin as he is going to travel back to Angola.  Today we will put him in a high tide boot that he will need at six weeks, and we will put him in a 1"" lift also.  He can weight bear until surgery and we will have it set up this week.

1103,"EXAMINATION: , Cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.,INDICATION: , Syncope with severe aortic stenosis.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  Following this, the catheters were removed.  Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.,2.  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,3.  4+ mitral regurgitation.,PLAN: , The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization.",Surgery

He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.,NUTRITIONAL HISTORY: , Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.  He takes his lunch (usually a sandwich and chips or yogurt and fruit) for lunch.  Mom or his sister cooks supper in the evening.

A barium swallow and upper GI was scheduled for the following week.  It showed marked GE reflux.,ASSESSMENT: , The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.,CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA. , Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.,PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.,  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.,GERD.,  The history of ""heartburn"" relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.,PLAN:,  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.

4383,"Chief Complaint:, Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, altered mental status.,History of Present Illness:, 55 yo WM with reactive airways disease, allergic rhinitis who was in his usual state of health until he underwent a dental extraction with administration of cephalexin 1 week prior to admission. Approximately one day after the dental procedure, he began having nausea, and abdominal pain along with fatigue. The abdominal pain was described as pressure-like and was located in the epigastrium and periumbilical regions. He initially attributed the symptoms to a side effect of the antibiotic he was taking. However, with worsening of his symptoms, he presented to the ER 5 days after dental extraction.,At that time his vitals were T 99.9 ° HR 115 RR 18 BP 182/101. His exam was notable for mild tenderness in the central abdomen. Laboratory evaluation was notable for WBC 15.6, Hgb 13.1, Plt 189, 16% bands, 68% PMNs. Na 127, K4.7, Cl 88, CO2 29, BUN 19, Cr 1.5, Glucose 155, Ca 9.6, alk phos 125, t bili 0.7, ALT 29, nl amylase and lipase. UA with 100 protein, lg blood, 53 RBC, 2 WBC. Plain films done at that time revealed dilation of small bowel loops in mid-abdomen up to 3.5cm in diameter, thought to be most consistent with a paralytic ileus. The patient was discharged home with diagnosis of medication-induced gastroenteritis vs. UTI. He was instructed to stop his current antibiotic but start Levaquin, and he was given Vicodin, and phenergan for symptomatic relief.,Over the next 2 days, the patient began having fevers, non-bloody emesis, diarrhea, and confusion in addition to his persistent nausea, and abdominal pain. On the night of presentation, the patient was found by a cousin in his bathroom lethargic and disoriented. EMS was called and patient was taken to the ER.

The right arm, axilla, and chest wall were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Longitudinal skin incision was made from the lower axilla distally down the medial aspect of the arm and the basilic vein was not apparent.  The draining veins are the deep brachial veins.  The primary vein was carefully dissected out and small tributaries clamped, divided, and ligated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  A nice length of vein was obtained to the distal one third of the arm.  This appeared to be of adequate length to transpose the vein through the subcutaneous tissue to an old occluded fistula vein, which remains patent through a small collateral vein.  A transverse skin incision was made over the superior aspect of the old fistula vein.  This vein was carefully dissected out and encircled with vascular tapes.  The brachial vein was then tunneled in a gentle curve above the bicep to the level of the cephalic vein fistula.  The patient was sensible, was then systemically heparinized.  The existing fistula vein was clamped proximally and distally, incised longitudinally for about a centimeter.  The brachial vein end was spatulated.  Subsequently, a branchial vein to arterialized fistula vein anastomosis was then constructed using running #6-0 Prolene suture in routine fashion.  After the completion of the anastomosis, the fistula vein was forebled and the branchial vein backbled.  The anastomosis was completed.  A nice thrill could be palpated over the outflow brachial vein.  Hemostasis was noted.  A 8 mm Blake drain was placed in the wound and brought out through inferior skin stab incision and ___ the skin with #3-0 nylon suture.  The wounds were then closed using interrupted #4-0 Vicryl and deep subcutaneous tissue ___ staples closed the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then x-ray'd and taken to Recovery in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss 50 mL, drains 8 mm Blake.

Then a retrobulbar injection of 2% Xylocaine was performed.  A lid speculum was applied and the conjunctiva was opened 4 mm from the limbus.  A 2-0 traction suture was passed around the insertion of the lateral rectus and the temporal one-half of the globe was exposed.  Next, the plaque was identified and the two scleral sutures were removed.  The plaque was gently extracted and the conjunctiva was re-sutured with 6-0 catgut, following removal of the traction suture.  The fundus was inspected with direct ophthalmoscopy.  An eye patch was applied following Neosporin solution irrigation.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition.  A lateral canthotomy had been done.",Ophthalmology
1131,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Carcinoma of the left upper lobe.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Bronchoscopy with aspiration.,2.  Left upper lobectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,With patient in supine position under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube in place, the flexible bronchoscope was then placed down through the endotracheal tube to examine the carina.  The carina was in the midline and sharp.  Moving directly to the right side, the right upper and middle lower lobes were examined and found to be free of obstructions.  Aspiration was carried out for backlog ________ examination.  We then moved to left side, left upper lobe.  There was a tumor mass located in the lingula of the left lobe and left lower lobe found free of obstruction.  No anatomic lesions were demonstrated.  The patient was prepared for left thoracotomy rotated to his right side with a double lumen endotracheal tube in place with an NG tube and a Foley catheter.  After proper position, utilizing Betadine solution, they were draped.  A posterolateral left thoracotomy incision was performed.  Hemostasis was secured with electrocoagulation.  The chest wall muscle was then divided over the sixth rib.  The periosteum of the sixth rib was then removed superiorly and the pleural cavity was entered carefully.  At this time, the mass was felt in the left upper lobe, which measures greater than 3 cm by palpation.  We examined the superior mediastinum.  No lymph nodes were demonstrated as well as in the anterior mediastinum.  Direction was then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery was separated into the left upper lobe.  Casual dissection was carried out with superior segmental arteries and left lower lobe was examined.,Dissection was carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe.  Direction was carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein was separated from the surrounding tissue.  From the top side, the bronchus was then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which was short.  Tumor mass was close to the artery at this time.  We then directed ourselves once again to the lingual artery which was doubly ligated and cut free.  The posterior artery of the superior branch was doubly ligated and cut free also.  At this time, the bronchus of the left upper lobe was encountered in the fissure on palpation to separate the upper lobe bronchus from lower lobe bronchus and the area was accomplished.  We then moved anteriorly to doubly ligate the pulmonary vein using #00 silk sutures for ligation and a transection #00 silk suture was used to fixate the vein.  Using sharp and blunt dissection, the bronchus through the left upper lobe was freed proximal.  Using the TA 50, the bronchus was then cut free allowing the lung to fall superiorly at which time direction was carried out to the pulmonary artery where the tumor was in close proximity at this time.  A Potts clamp arterial was then placed over the artery and shaving off the tumor and the apical posterior artery was then accomplished.  The anterior artery was seen in the clamp also and was separated and ligated and separated.  At this time, the entire tumor in the left upper lobe was then removed.  ,Direction was carried to the suture where #000 silk was used as a running suture over the pulmonary artery and was here doubly run and tied in place.  The clamp was then removed.  No bleeding was seen at this time.  Lymph nodes were then removed from the sump of the separation between the upper lobe and the lower lobe and sent for separate pathology.  We then carried out incision in the inferior pulmonary ligament up to the pulmonary vein allowing the lung to reexpand to its normal position.  At this time, two chest tubes #28 and #32 were placed anteriorly and posteriorly to fixate the skin using raw silk suture.  The chest cavity was then closed.  After reexamination, no bleeding was seen with three pericostal sutures of #1 chromic double strength.  A #2-0 Polydek was then used to close the chest wall muscle the anterior as well as latissimus dorsi #000 chromic subcutaneous tissue skin clips to the skin.  The chest tubes were attached to the Pleur-Evac drainage and placed on suction at this time.  The patient was extubated in the room without difficulty and sent to Recovery in satisfactory.",Surgery
4981,"SUMMARY OF CLINICAL HISTORY:,  The patient was a 35-year-old African-American male with no significant past medical history who called EMS with shortness of breath and chest pain.  Upon EMS arrival, patient was tachypneic at 40 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of 90%.  At the scene, EMS administered breathing treatments and checked lung sounds that did not reveal any evidence of fluid in the lung fields.  EMS also reports patient was agitated upon their arrival at his residence.  Two minutes after arrival at UTMB at 1500, the patient became unresponsive, apneic, and had oxygen saturations from 80-90%.  The patient's heart rate decreased to asystole, was intubated with good breath sounds and air movement.  Patient then had wide complex bradycardia and ACLS protocol for pulseless electrical activity was followed for 45 minutes.  The patient was administered TPA with no improvement.  Bedside echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion.  The patient was administered D5W, Narcan, and multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate.  The patient had three episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation with cardioversion/defibrillation resulting in asystole.  The patient was pronounced dead at 1605 with fixed, dilated pupils, no heart sounds, no pulse and no spontaneous respirations.,DESCRIPTION OF GROSS LESIONS,EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:,  The body is that of a 35-year-old well-developed, well-nourished male.  There is no peripheral edema of the extremities.  There is an area of congestion/erythema on the upper chest and anterior neck.  There are multiple small areas of hemorrhage bilaterally in the conjunctiva.  A nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are in place.  There is an intravenous line in the right hand and left femoral region.  The patient has multiple lead pads on the thorax.  The patient has no other major surgical scars.,INTERNAL EXAMINATION (BODY CAVITIES):,  The right and left pleural cavity contains 10 ml of clear fluid with no adhesions.  The pericardial sac is yellow, glistening without adhesions or fibrosis and contains 30 ml of a straw colored fluid.  There is minimal fluid in the peritoneal cavity.,HEART:,  The heart is large with a normal shape and a weight of 400 grams.  The pericardium is intact.  The epicardial fat is diffusely firm.  As patient was greater than 48 hours post mortem, no TTC staining was utilized.  Upon opening the heart was grossly normal without evidence of infarction.  There were slightly raised white plaques in the left ventricle wall lining.  The left ventricle measures 2.2 cm, the right ventricle measures 0.2 cm, the tricuspid ring measures 11 cm, the pulmonic right measures 8 cm, the mitral ring measures 10.2 cm, and the aortic ring measures 7 cm.  The foramen ovale is closed.  The circulation is left dominant.  Examination of the great vessels of the heart reveals minimal atherosclerosis with the area of greatest stenosis (20% stenosis) at the bifurcation of the LAD.,AORTA:,  There is minimal atherosclerosis with no measurable plaques along the full length of the ascending and descending aorta.,LUNGS: , The right lung weighed 630 grams, the left weighed 710 grams.  The lung parenchyma is pink without evidence of congestion of hemorrhage.  The bronchi are grossly normal.  In the right lung, there are two large organizing thrombo-emboli.  The first is located at the first branch of the pulmonary artery with an older, organizing area adherent to the vessel wall measuring 1.0 x 1.0 x 2.5 cm.  Surrounding this organizing area is a newer area of apparent thrombosis completely occluding the bifurcation.  The other large organizing, adherent embolus is located further in out in the vasculature measuring approximately 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.5 cm.  There are multiple other emboli located in smaller pulmonary vessels that show evidence of distending the vessels they are located inside.,GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:,  The esophagus and stomach are normal in appearance without evidence of ulcers or varices.  The stomach contains approximately 800 ml, without evidence of any pills or other non-foodstuff material.  The pancreas shows a normal lobular cut surface with evidence of autolysis.  The duodenum, ileum, jejunum and colon are all grossly normal without evidence of abnormal vasculature or diverticula.  An appendix is present and is unremarkable.  The liver weighs 2850 grams and the cut surface reveals a normal liver with no fibrosis present grossly.  The gallbladder is in place with a probe patent bile duct through to the ampulla of Vater.,RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM:,  The spleen is large weighing 340 grams, the cut surface reveals a normal appearing white and red pulp.  No abnormally large lymph nodes were noted.,GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:,  The right kidney weighs 200 grams, the left weighs 210 grams.  The left kidney contains a 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 simple cyst containing a clear fluid.  The cut surface reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla with intact calyces.  The prostate and seminal vessels were cut revealing normal appearing prostate and seminal vesicle tissue without evidence of inflammation or embolus.,ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:,  The adrenal glands are in the normal position and weigh 8.0 grams on the right and 11.6 grams on the left.  The cut surface of the adrenal glands reveals a normal appearing cortex and medulla.  The thyroid gland weighs 12.4 grams and is grossly normal.,EXTREMITIES:,  Both legs and calves were measured and found to be very similar in circumference.  Both legs were also milked and produced no clots in the venous system.,CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATION,This patient died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature., ,The most significant finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple old and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the right lung.  The autopsy revealed evidence of multiple emboli in the right lung that were at least a few days old because the emboli that were organizing were adherent to the vessel wall.  In order to be adherent to the vessel wall, the emboli must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response, which takes at least a few days.  The fatal event was not the old emboli in the right lung, but rather the thrombosis on top of the large saddle thrombus residing in the pulmonary artery.  This created a high-pressure situation that the right ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac dysfunction and ultimately the patient's demise.,Although this case is fairly straight forward in terms of what caused the terminal event, perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively healthy 35-year-old man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism.  Virchow's triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury, stasis and a hypercoagulable state as possible etiologies.  The age of the patient probably precludes venous stasis as the sole reason for the embolus although it could have certainly contributed.  The autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused the occlusion.  The next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state.  Some possibilities include obesity, trauma, surgery, cancer, Factor V Leiden deficiency (as well as other inherited disorders-prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies in protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III, and disorders of plasminogen), and Lupus anticoagulant.  Of these risks factors, obesity was the only risk factor the patient was known to have.  The patient had no evidence of trauma, surgery, cancer or the stigmata of SLE, therefore these are unlikely.  Perhaps the most fruitful search would be an examination of the genetic possibilities for a hypercoagulable state (Factor V Leiden being the most common).,In summary, this patient died of a pulmonary embolism, the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined.  A definitive diagnosis may be ascertained with either genetic or other laboratory tests and a more detailed history.,SUMMARY AND REFLECTION,WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS AUTOPSY:,  I learned that although a cause of death may sometimes be obvious, the underlying mechanism for the death may still be elusive.  This patient was an otherwise completely healthy 35-year-old man with one known risk factor for a hypercoagulable state.,REMAINING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS:,  Basically the cause of the hypercoagulable state is undetermined.  Once that question is answered I believe this autopsy will have done a great service for the patient's family.",Autopsy

She requested appendectomy because of the concern of future diagnostic dilemma with pain crisis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were recommended to her.  The procedure was explained in detail including the risks of bleeding, infection, biliary injury, retained common duct stones.  After answering her questions, she wished to proceed and gave informed consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  She was positively identified and the correct surgical site and procedure reviewed.  After successful administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the skin of the abdomen was prepped with chlorhexidine solution and sterilely draped.,The infraumbilical skin was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and horizontal incision created.  The linea alba was grasped with a hemostat and Veress needle was placed into the peritoneal cavity and used to insufflate carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm expandable disposable trocar was placed and through this a 30 degree laparoscope was used to inspect the peritoneal cavity.  Upper abdominal anatomy was normal.  Pelvic laparoscopy revealed bilaterally closed internal inguinal rings.  Additional trocars were placed under direct vision including a 5-mm reusable in the right lateral _____.  There was a 12-mm expandable disposable in the right upper quadrant and a 5-mm reusable in the subxiphoid region.  Using these, the gallbladder was grasped and retraced cephalad.  Adhesions were taken down over the cystic duct and the duct was circumferentially dissected and clipped at the gallbladder cystic duct junction.  A small ductotomy was created.  Reddick cholangiogram catheter was then placed within the duct and the balloon inflated.  Continuous fluoroscopy was used to instill contrast material.  This showed normal common bile duct which entered the duodenum without obstruction.  There was no evidence of common bile duct stones.  The cholangiogram catheter was removed.  The duct was doubly clipped and divided.  The artery was divided and cauterized.  The gallbladder was taken out of the gallbladder fossa.  It was then placed in Endocatch bag and left in the abdomen.  Attention was then paid to the appendix.  The appendix was identified and window was made in the mesoappendix at the base.  This was amputated with an Endo-GIA stapler.  The mesoappendix was divided with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler.  This was placed in another Endocatch bag.  The abdomen was then irrigated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  Both the appendix and gallbladder were removed and sent for pathology.  All trocars were removed.  The 12-mm port sites were closed with 2-0 PDS figure-of-eight fascial sutures.  The umbilical skin was reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The remaining skin incisions were closed with 5-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.  The skin was cleaned.  Mastisol, Steri-Strips and band-aids were applied.

She has done quite well with this.  She now has had worsening left knee pain predominantly on the inside of her knee and has consented for unicompartmental knee replacement on the left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  After appropriate anesthesia, the left lower extremity was identified with a time out procedure.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  Left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion after applying a thigh tourniquet.  The tourniquet was insufflated after elevation of the limb, and a standard medial parapatellar incision was used.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down the retinaculum, was opened sharply to expose the joint, meniscus that was visible along the tibia was removed.  The anterior fat pad was removed.  The knee was then examined.  The ACL was found to be intact.  The lateral compartment had very minimal arthritis.  There were some osteoarthritic changes of the patellofemoral joint, but these were felt to be mild.  Following this, the tibial external alignment guide was placed and pinned into place in the appropriate place.  Tibial bone cut was made and checked with a feeler gauge and felt to be an adequate resection.  Following this resection, the femoral intramedullary guide was placed without difficulty.  The femoral cutting guide was then placed and referenced off of this femoral intramedullary guide.  Once in the appropriate position, it was pinned and drilled.  This was removed, and the posterior cutting block was inserted.  It was impacted into place.  Posterior bone cut was made for the medium femoral component.  Next, a zero spigot was used and the distal femur was reamed.  Following this, the check of the extension and flexion gaps revealed that an additional 1 mm needed to be reamed, so 1 spigot was used and this was reamed as well.  Next, trial components were placed into the knee and the knee was taken through range of motion and felt to come out to full extension with a 3 mm poly with a good fit.  Next, the tibia was prepared.  The tibial tray was pinned into place, and the cuts for the keel of the tibia were made.  These were removed with a small osteotome from the set.  Following this, a trial tibial with the keel was placed and it did fit nicely.  After this, all trial components were removed.  The knee was copiously irrigated.  Cement was begun mixing.  Drill holes were used along the femur for cement interdigitation.  The wound was cleaned and dried.  Cement was placed on the tibia.  Tibial tray was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  Tibia was placed in the femur.  Femoral component was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  It was held with a 4 mm trial insert and approximately 30 degrees of knee flexion until the cement had hardened.  Following this, it was again trialed with a meniscal bearing implant and it was felt that 3 mm would be the appropriate size.  A 3 mm polyethylene was chosen and inserted in the knee without difficulty, taken through range of motion and found to come out to full extension with no impingement and full flexion.  The intramedullary rod removed from the femur.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The retinaculum was closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 Monocryl was used for the subcutaneous tissue and staples used for the skin.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Tourniquet was then desufflated.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  Dr. Jinnah was present for the surgery.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will be weightbearing as tolerated in the left lower extremity and will be maintained on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.  Prior to closure, the posterior capsule was injected with the joint cocktail.",Surgery

2088,"Chief Complaint:, Back and hip pain.,History of Present Illness:, The patient is a 73 year old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease secondary to reflux nephropathy / restriction of bladder neck requiring hemodialysis and eventual cadaveric renal transplant now on chronic immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease with non-healing ulcer of right great toe, and peripheral neuropathy who initially presented to his primary care physician in May 2001 with complaints of low back pain and bilateral hip pain. The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics,In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient’s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis. It also revealed an abnormal enhancing lesion in the left proximal femur, the left iliac bone, the right iliac bone, and possibly the right tibia.,Past Medical History:,End stade renal disease secondary to reflux nephropathy,a. numerous related urinary tract infections,b. hemodialysis (1983-1988),c. s/p cadaveric renal transplant (1988),d. baseline creatinine about 2.3.,Hypertension,Peripheral vascular disease,a. history of right foot infected toenail and non-healing ulcer since 2000; receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy; recent surgery on infected toe in March, 2002,Peripheral Neuropathy,Chronic anemia (on Epogen injections),History of several partial small bowel obstructions - six times during the last 10 years,Past Surgical History:,1.

917,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right ankle trimalleolar fracture.,2.  Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Delayed open reduction internal fixation with plates and screws, 6-hole contoured distal fibular plate and screws reducing posterolateral malleolar fragment, as well as medial malleolar fragment.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right ankle trimalleolar fracture.,2.  Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 80 minutes.,HISTORY: , This 50-year-old gentleman was from the area and riding his motorcycle in Kentucky.,The patient lost control of his motorcycle when he was traveling approximately 40 mile per hour.  He was on a curve and lost control.  He is unsure what exactly happened, but he thinks his right ankle was pinned underneath the motorcycle while he was sliding.  There were no other injuries.  He was treated in Kentucky.  A close reduction was performed and splint applied.  Orthopedic surgeon called myself with regards to this patient's fracture management and suggested a CT scan.  The patient returned to Ohio and his friend drove him all the way from Kentucky to Northwest Ohio overnight.  The patient showed up in the emergency department where a CT scan was asked to be performed.  This was performed and reviewed.  The patient, however, had significant amount of soft tissue swelling and therefore he was asked to follow up in 2 days.  At this time, he still had significant swelling, but because of the amount of swelling that he had particularly with the long car ride for many hours with his leg dependent, it was felt to be best to wait.,Indeed after 7 days, the patient started to develop fracture blisters on the posterior medial aspect of his ankle with large blisters measuring approximately 2 to 3 inches.  The patient was x-rayed in the office.  He had lost some of his reduction.  Therefore, he was re-reduced at approximately 7 days and then each time the patient had examination of tissues, he was re-reduced just to keep the pressure off the skin.,An x-ray showed the distal fibular fracture starting at the mortise region laterally.  It appeared as an abduction type injury with minimal rotation.  This was comminuted, fragmented, and impacted.,The medial malleolus fracture was an avulsion type.  The syndesmosis appeared to be intact.  This appeared as an AO type B fracture.  However, this was not a rotational injury.,There is a posterior malleolar fragment attached to the distal fibular fragment, which appeared to be avulsed as well, but comminuted.  CT scan revealed a more serious fracture with an anterior as well as posterior plafond fracture of an anterior fragment, which was undisplaced in the posterior medial corner.  A posterior Tillaux fragment appeared to be separate.  However, in this area, there was significant comminution in the mid portion of the ankle joint.,There were many fragments and defects in this region.,The medial mortise however appeared to be intact with regards to the tibial plafond even though there was an anterior undisplaced fragment.,We discussed delayed open reduction internal fixation with the patient.  He understood the risk of surgery including infection, decreased range of motion, stiffness, neurovascular injury, weakness, and numbness.  We discussed seriously the risk of osteoarthritis because of the comminution in the intraarticular surface shown on the CT scan.  We discussed deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, skin slough, skin necrosis, infection, and need for second surgery.  We discussed shortening, decreased strength, limited use, disability of operative extremity, malunion, nonunion, compartment syndrome, stiffness of the operative extremity, numbness, and weakness.  Examination of the patient revealed that he had slightly decreased sensation on the dorsum of his foot.,The patient was able to flex and extend his toes, had good capillary refill, good dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse.,The patient's tissues were edematous and we has waited approximately 10 days before performing the surgery when the skin could be wrinkled anteriorly.  We discussed his incision, the medial incision as well as lateral incision and the lateral incision would be more posterolateral to maintain a bridge of at least 6 to 8 cm between the 2 incisions.  We did discuss the skin slough as well as skin necrosis, particularly medially where the most skin pressure was because of displacement laterally.  He understood the posterolateral comminution of the tibial plafond, which would be reduced by aligning up the cortex posteriorly.,We discussed the posterolateral approach with reduction of the fibula.  We discussed that likely the distal fibula would not be removed completely to assess the articular surface as this would likely comminute the fibula, even more fragmentation would occur, and would not be able to obtain an anatomic reduction.  He understood this distal fibular fracture was comminuted and there were missing fragments of bone because they were impacted into intramedullary cancellous space.  With this, the patient understood that the hardware may necessitate removal as well in the future.  We discussed hardware irritation.  We also discussed risk of osteoarthritis, which was nearly 100% particularly because of comminution of this area posteriorly.  With these risks discussed and listed on the consent, the patient wanted the procedure.,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was brought to operating theater and given successful general anesthetic.  His right leg was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Before prep and drape was performed, a close reduction was tried to be obtained to see whether there was any obstruction to reduction.  It was felt that at one point the posterior tibialis tendon may be intraarticular.,The reduction appeared to line up.  However, there was significant gap of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm between the avulsed medial malleolus fragment and distal tibia.,A lateral incision was made over the fracture site approximately 8 cm long and was taken to subcutaneous tissue.  The superficial peroneal nerve was seen and this was avoided.  The incision was placed posterolateral to fibula.,This was to ensure good flap of tissue between the 2 incisions medial and laterally.  The fracture was seen.  The fracture was elevated and medialized and de-rotated.  The anterior portion of the distal fibula was significantly comminuted with defect.  The posterior aspect was still intact.  However, there were multiple fracture lines demonstrating a crush-type injury.  This was reduced manually.  At this point, dissection was performed bluntly behind the peroneal tendons in between this and flexor hallucis longus tendon.  No sharp dissection was performed.  The posterior malleolar fragment was palpated with the distal fibula reduced.  The posterior malleolar fragment appeared to be reduced as well.,X-ray views confirmed this.,An incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus.  This was taken only through subcutaneous tissue.  The saphenous vein was found, dissected out.  Its branches were cauterized.  Penrose drain was placed around this.,Dissection was undertaken.  The periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint.,This was recovered and flipped back on both sides.  Next, the towel clip was used.  Ends were freshened up using irrigation.  The joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially.,Anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm K-wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws.  Anatomic reduction was gained.  X-rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction.  Next, attention was drawn towards the fibula.  Standard 6-hole one-third tubular plate was applied to this.  Again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture.  Therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used.,The posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction.  Screws were placed.  It was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially.,Screw holes were filled.  They were double-checked.  Screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up.  At this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond.  This appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia.,The screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment.,A 2 mm K-wire was used.  Finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger.  X-ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin.  This was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed.  This was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so.  On the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint.  AP views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint.  One could palpate this as well.  The screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane.  At the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint.  There was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment.  Wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2-0 Vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with Kerlix followed by an extensor bandage.  Posterior splint was placed on the patient.  The patient's leg was placed in neutral position.  Significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma ABD type dressings.  The heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding.  Tourniquet was deflated.  The patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications.  Physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied.  Positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant.  As well, physician assistant assisted in transport of patient to and from the recovery room, assisted in cautery as well as dissection and retraction of tissue.  The patient is expected to do well overall.  He does have an area of comminution shown on the CT scan.  However, by x-rays, it appears that there is anatomic reduction gained at this posterolateral fragment.  Nonetheless, this area was crushed and the patient will have degenerative changes in the future caused by this crushing area.",Surgery

4858,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Atrial fibrillation.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 78-year-old, Hispanic woman with past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post bypass grafting surgery and history of a stroke with residual left sided hemiplegia.  Apparently, the patient is a resident of Lake Harris Port Square long-term facility after her stroke.  She was found to have confusion while in her facility.  She then came to the emergency room and found to have a right sided acute stroke.  12-lead EKG performed on August 10, 2009, found to have atrial fibrillation.  Telemetry also revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  Currently, the telemetry is normal sinus rhythm.  Because of the finding of atrial fibrillation, cardiology was consulted.,The patient is a poor historian.  She did not recall why she is in the hospital, she said she had a stroke.  She reported no chest discomfort, no shortness of breath, no palpitations.,The following information was obtained from the patient's chart:,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,1.  Coronary artery disease status post bypass grafting surgery.  Unable to obtain the place, location, anatomy, and the year it was performed.,2.

Right side carotid bruit heard.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  PMI not displaced, regular rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  Positive S4.  There is a 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.,EXTREMITIES:  Not edematous.,DATA:,  A 12-lead EKG performed on August 9, 2009, revealed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 96 beats per minute, nonspecific ST wave abnormality.,Review of telemetry done the last few days, currently the patient is in normal sinus rhythm at the rate of 60 beats per minute.  Atrial fibrillation was noted on admission noted August 8 and August 10; however, there was normal sinus rhythm on August 10.,LABORATORY DATA: , WBC 7.2, hemoglobin 11.7.  The patient's hemoglobin was 8.2 a few days ago before blood transfusion.  Chemistry-7 within normal limits.  Lipid profile:  Triglycerides 64, total cholesterol 106, HDL 26, LDL 17.  Liver function tests are within normal limits.  INR was 1.1.,A 2D echo was performed on August 11, 2009, and revealed left ventricle normal in size with EF of 50%.  Mild apical hypokinesis.  Mild dilated left atrium.  Mild aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.  No intracardiac masses or thrombus were noted.  The aortic root was normal in size.,ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  It is unknown if this is a new onset versus a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Given the patient has a recurrent stroke, anticoagulation with Coumadin to prevent further stroke is indicated.  However, given the patient's current neurologic status, the safety of falling is unclear.  We need to further discuss with the patient's primary care physician, probably rehab physician.  If the patient's risk of falling is low, then Coumadin is indicated.  However, if the patient's risk for falling is high, then a course using aspirin and Plavix will be recommended.  Transesophageal echocardiogram probably will delineate possible intracardiac thrombus better, however will not change our current management.  Therefore, I will not recommend transesophageal echocardiogram at this point.  Currently, the patient's heart rate is well controlled, antiarrhythmic agent is not recommended at this point.,2.  Carotid artery stenosis.  The patient underwent a carotid Doppler ultrasound on this admission and found to have a high-grade increased velocity of the right internal carotid artery.  It is difficult to assess the severity of the stenosis given the history of possible right carotid stenting.  If clinically indicated, CT angio of the carotid will be indicated to assess for stent patency.  However, given the patient's current acute stroke, revascularization is not indicated at this time.,3.  Coronary artery disease.  Clinically stable.  No further test is indicated at this time.",Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
593,"OPERATION,1.  Right upper lung lobectomy.,2.  Mediastinal lymph node dissection.,ANESTHESIA,1.  General endotracheal anesthesia with dual-lumen tube.,2.  Thoracic epidural.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered with a dual-lumen tube.  Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in good condition.",Surgery

Oxyhemoglobin saturation remained in the low to mid 90s throughout the night.,Intermittent inspiratory flow limitation compatible with snoring was observed during non-REM sleep.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This patient presents with history of sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness with fatigue.  Her symptoms are multifactorial.,Regarding the etiology of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, the patient has a component of psychophysiologic insomnia, based on reports of better sleep in the laboratory as compared to home.  In addition, nontrivial smoking in the home setting may be contributing significantly to sleep disruption.,Regarding her daytime sleepiness, the patient is taking a number of long-acting central nervous system acting medications to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime.  These include trazodone, Seroquel, and methadone.  Of these medications, the methadone is clearly indicative, given the history of substance abuse.  It would be desirable to reduce or discontinue trazodone and then perhaps consider doing the same with Seroquel.  I brought this possibility up with the patient, and I asked her to discuss this further with her psychiatrist.,Finally, to help mitigate sleep disruption at night, I have provided her with tips for sleep hygiene.  These include bedtime rituals, stimulus control therapy, and sleep restriction as well as avoidance of nicotine in the evening hours.",Sleep Medicine

319,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma.  The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition.",Surgery

The right ovary and fallopian tube appeared normal.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  The uterus appeared normal in size.  There were no pelvic adhesions noted.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gravida 0, para 0 Caucasian female who presents with a left adnexal mass on ultrasound which is 5.3 cm.  She does complain of minimal discomfort.  Bimanual exam was not able to be performed secondary to the vaginal stenosis and completely intact hymen.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the Operative Suite, prepped and draped, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 1 cm skin incision was made in the infraumbilical vault.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty and the abdomen was insufflated.  This was done using appropriate flow and volume of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty.  The above findings were confirmed.  A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization.  Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.  Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating.  The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision.  The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors.  The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site.  Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic.  All the port sites were hemostatic as well.  The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The remaining incisions were also closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running fashion after all instruments were removed and the abdomen was completely desufflated.  Steri-Strips were placed on each of the incisions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were x2.

The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result was achieved.  No tourniquet was used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot.  He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications.  Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations.,He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches.  He will elevate his right foot and rest the foot, keep it clean and dry.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday of next week.",Surgery

Her last visit to this clinic was approximately three months ago.  Since that time, the patient states that she has had some variability in her glucose control too largely to recent upper and lower respiratory illnesses.  She did not seek attention for these, and the symptoms have begun to subside on their own and in the meantime, she continues to have some difficulties with blood sugar management.  Her 14-day average is 191.  She had a high blood sugar this morning, which she attributed to a problem with her infusion set; however, in the clinic after an appropriate correction bolus, she subsequently became quite low.  She was treated appropriately with glucose and crackers, and her blood sugar came back up to over 100.  She was able to manage this completely on her own.

She has had variability in her glucose control, and the plan today is to continue her current regimen, which includes the following:  Basal rate, 12 a.m. 0.6 units per hour, 4 a.m. 0.7 units per hour, and 9 a.m. 0.6 units per hour.  Her target pre-meal is 120 and bedtime is 150.  Her insulin/carbohydrate ratio is 10 and her correction factor is 60.  We are not going to make any changes to her insulin pump settings at this time.  I have encouraged her to watch the number of processed high-calorie foods that she is consuming late at night.  She has agreed to try that and cut back on this a little bit.

556,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Soft tissue mass, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Soft tissue mass, right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Excision of soft tissue mass, right foot.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 51-year-old female with complaints of soft tissue mass over the dorsum of the right foot.  The patient has had previous injections to the site which have caused the mass to decrease in size, however, the mass continues to be present and is irritated and painful with shoes.  The patient has requested surgical intervention at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted from the preoperative holding area to the operating room.  The patient was then placed on the operating room table in the supine position and a towel was placed around the patient's abdomen and secured her to the table.  Using copious amounts of Webril, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied to her right ankle.  Using a Skin Skribe, the area of the soft tissue mass was outlined over the dorsum of her foot.  After adequate amount of anesthesia was provided by the Department of Anesthesia, a local ankle block was given using 10 cc of 4.5 mL of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1.0 mL of Solu-Medrol and the foot was scrubbed and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  Following this, the ankle was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot and the ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought back down to the table using bandage scissors.  The stockinette was reflected and the right foot was exposed.  Using a fresh #10 blade, a curvilinear incision was performed over the dorsum of the right foot.  Then using a #15 blade, the incision was deepened with care taken to identify and avoid or cauterize any bleeders which were noted.  Following this, the incision was deepened using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection and the muscle belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle was identified.  Further dissection was then performed in the medial direction in the area of the soft tissue mass.  The intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve was identified and gently retracted laterally.  Large amounts of adipose tissue were noted medial to the belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle.  Using careful dissection, adipose tissue in this area was removed and saved for pathology.  Following removal of adipose tissue in this area and identification of no more adipose tissue, attention was directed lateral to the belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, which was also noted to have large amounts of adipose tissue in this area as well.  Using careful dissection, from the lateral border of the foot as much adipose tissue as possible was removed from this area as well and saved for pathology.  There was noted to be no other fluid-filled masses or lesions identifiable in this area then between the slits of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, careful dissection was performed to examine the underside of the belly of the muscle as well as structures beneath and no abnormal structures were identified here as well.  Following this, feeling adequately that no other mass remained in the area, the incision was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline.  The wound was then reinspected and all remaining tissues appeared healthy including the subcutaneous tissue.  The tendon and muscle belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, the nerves of the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve and also the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve which were identified medially, all appeared intact.  No deficits were noted.  No abnormal appearing tissue was present within the surgical site.  Following this, the skin edges were reapproximated using #4-0 Vicryl deep closure of the subcutaneous layer was performed.  Then, using #4-0 nylon and simple interrupted suture, the skin was reapproximated and closed with care taken to ensure eversion of the skin edges and good approximation of the borders.  The patient was also given 7 cc of 1% lidocaine plain throughout the procedure to augment local anesthesia.  Following this, the wound was dressed using Xeroform gauze and 4x4s and was dressed using two ABD pads, dorsal and plantar for compression and using Kling, Kerlix and Coban.  The patient then had the ankle tourniquet deflated with a total tourniquet time of 55 minutes at 250 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to digits one through five of the right foot.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was noted to have vascular status intact.  The patient was then escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where she was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then given postoperative instructions to include ice and elevation to her right foot.  The patient was cleared for ambulation as tolerated, but was instructed that with increased ambulation will come increased swelling and pain.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X in his office on Tuesday, 08/26/03 for further follow up.  The patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen #25 taken one tablet q.4h. p.r.n., moderate to severe pain and also prescription for Keflex #20 500 mg tablets to be taken b.i.d. x10 days.  The patient was given a number for the Emergency Room and instructed to return if any sign or symptom of infection should present and the patient was educated as to the nature of these.  The patient had no further questions and recovered without any complications in the Postanesthesia Care Unit.",Surgery

He presents today with diarrhea and bleeding.  Digital exam reveals bright red blood on the finger.  He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time.,FINDINGS: , There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before.  In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa.  There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture.  No other obvious bleeding was seen.,TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position.  After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position.  His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor.  The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery.  There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well.  This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture.  At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.",Gastroenterology

4622,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , I was kindly asked to see this patient for transesophageal echocardiogram performance by Dr. A and Neurology.  Please see also my cardiovascular consultation dictated separately.  But essentially, this is a pleasant 72-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left-sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry.  She has been recommended for a transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her CNS insult.,I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter, who was present at the patient's bedside with the patient's verbal consent.  I then performed a risk/benefit/alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts; alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging, which she had already had, with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management, which the patient was not interested in; risks including, but not limited to, and the patient was aware this was not an all-inclusive list, of oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, risk of oropharyngeal, esophageal, oral, tracheal, pulmonary and/or gastric perforation, hemorrhage, or tear.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk/benefit/alternative analysis, had the opportunity to ask questions, which I invited from her and her daughter, all of which were answered to their self-stated satisfaction.  The patient then stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram.,PROCEDURE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient, position, physician, procedure documentation; there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself.  She received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect.  The multi-plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes, after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition.  This was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus, then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate imaging obtained throughout.  She was recovered as per the Medical Center conscious sedation protocol, and there were no apparent complications of the procedure.,FINDINGS: , Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  LVEF of 60%.  Mild left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.  Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.  No left ventricular wall motion abnormalities identified.  The four pulmonary veins are identified.  The left atrial appendage is interrogated, including with Doppler and color flow, and while there is good to-and-fro motion seen, echo smoke is seen, and in fact, an intracardiac thrombus is identified and circumscribed at 1.83 cm in circumference at the base of the left atrial appendage.  No intracardiac vegetations nor endocarditis seen on any of the intracardiac valves.  The mitral valve is seen.  There is mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.  No mitral stenosis.  Four pulmonary veins were identified without reversible pulmonary venous flow.  There are three cusps of the aortic valve seen.  No aortic stenosis.  There is trace aortic insufficiency.  There is trace pulmonic insufficiency.  The pulmonary artery is seen and is within normal limits.  There is trace to mild tricuspid regurgitation.  Unable to estimate PA systolic pressure accurately; however, on the recent transthoracic echocardiogram (which I would direct the reader to) on January 5, 2010, RVSP was calculated at 40 mmHg on that study.  E wave velocity on average is 0.95 m/sec with a deceleration time of 232 milliseconds.  The proximal aorta is within normal limits, annulus 1.19 cm, sinuses of Valsalva 2.54 cm, ascending aorta 2.61 cm.  The intra-atrial septum is identified as are the SVC and IVC, and these are within normal limits.  The intra-atrial septum is interrogated with color flow as well as agitated D5W and there is no evidence of intracardiac shunting, including no atrial septal defect nor patent foramen ovale.  No pericardial effusion.  There is mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis seen.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.

His previous PSAs were in the 1 range.  TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden.  After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy.  Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision.  The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room here.  Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area.  The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field.  Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision.  A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus.  Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle.  Space of rectus sheath was then entered.  The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area.  The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected.  This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein.  Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall.  The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally.  Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves.  An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated.  The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation.  The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad.  The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia.  The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments.  Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders.  A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle.  A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis.  Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide.  Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter.  The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra.  The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end.  The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end.  The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety.  A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex.  The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut.  Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue.  Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal.  Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete.  Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia.  The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  The rest of the mucosa was then everted.  The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  Hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  FloSeal was applied to the pelvis.  The bladder was then irrigated.  It was draining pink urine.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS.  The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU.  Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted.  This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation.",Urology

All endometriosis had been identified laparoscopically from a previous surgery.  At the time of the surgery, all the tissue was quite thick and difficult to cut as well around the bladder flap and the uterus itself.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position, at which time general form of anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia department.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  Approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis, a first knife was used to make a low transverse incision.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher.  Both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was then completed consistent with Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the midline and extended in a vertical fashion.  Perineum was entered at the high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  An O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was put in place on either side.  A bladder blade was put in place as well.  Uterus was grasped with a double-tooth tenaculum and large and small colon were packed away cephalically and held in place with free wet lap packs and a superior blade.  The bladder flap was released with Metzenbaum scissors and then dissected away caudally.  EndoGIA were placed down both sides of the uterus in two bites on each side with the staples reinforced with a medium Endoclip.  Two Heaney were placed on either side of the uterus at the level of cardinal ligaments.  These were sharply incised and both pedicles were tied off with 1 Vicryl suture.  Two _____ were placed from either side of the uterus at the level just inferior to the cervix across the superior part of the vaginal vault.  A long sharp knife was used to transect the uterus at the level of Merz forceps and the uterus and cervix were removed intact.  From there, the corners of the vaginal cuff were reinforced with figure-of-eight stitches.  Betadine soaked sponge was placed in the vaginal vault and a continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the edges with a second layer used to reinforce the first.  Bladder flap was created with the use of 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam was placed underneath.  The EndoGIA was used to transect both the fallopian tube and ovaries at the infundibulopelvic ligament and each one was reinforced with medium clips.  The entire area was then re-peritonized and copious amounts of saline were used to irrigate the pelvic cavity.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was placed into the cul-de-sac and the O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was removed as well as all the wet lap pack.  Edges of the peritoneum were grasped in 3 quadrants with hemostat and a continuous locking stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the peritoneum as well as abdominal rectus muscle.  The edges of the fascia were grasped at both corners and a continuous locking stitch of 1 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the fascia with overlapping in the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the tissue and the skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied and Betadine soaked sponge was removed from the vaginal vault and the vaginal vault was wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct.",Obstetrics / Gynecology

Osteophyte lateral femoral condyle, right knee.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:, Excision of capsular mass and arthrotomy with ostectomy of lateral femoral condyle, right knee.,SPECIFICATION: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operating Suite, room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done under a local and IV sedation via the Anesthesia Department.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:,  This is a 37-year-old African-American male with a mass present at the posterolateral aspect of his right knee.  On aspiration, it was originally attempted to no avail.  There was a long-standing history of this including two different MRIs, one about a year ago and one very recently both of which did not delineate the mass present.  During aspiration previously, the patient had experienced neuritic type symptoms down his calf, which have mostly resolved by the time that this had occurred.  The patient continued to complain of pain and dysfunction to his calf.  This was discussed with him at length.  He wished this to be explored and the mass excised even though knowing the possibility that they would not change his pain pattern with the potential of reoccurrence as well as the potential of scar stiffness, swelling, and peroneal nerve palsy.  With this, he decided to proceed.,Upon observation preoperatively, the patient was noted to have a hard mass present to the posterolateral aspect of the right knee.  It was noted to be tender.  It was marked preoperatively prior to an anesthetic.  Upon dissection, the patient was noted to have significant thickening of the posterior capsule.  The posterolateral aspect of the knee above the posterolateral complex at the gastroc attachment to the lateral femoral condyle.  There was also noted to be prominence of the lateral femoral condyle ridge.  The bifurcation at the tibial and peroneal nerves were identified and no neuroma was present.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table.  After receiving IV sedation, he was placed prone.  Thigh tourniquet was placed.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A transverse incision was carried down across the crease with a mass had been palpated through skin and subcutaneous tissue after exsanguination of the limb and tourniquet utilized.  The nerve was identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  Both nerves were identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  There was noted to be no neuroma present.  This was taken down until the gastroc was split.  There was gross thickening of the joint capsule and after arthrotomy, a section of the capsule was excised.  The lateral femoral condyle was then osteophied.  We then smoothed off with a rongeur.  After this, we could not palpate any mass whatsoever placing pressure upon the area of the nerve.  Tourniquet was deflated.  It was checked again.  There was no excessive swelling.  Swanson drain was placed to the depth of the wound and interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and #4-0 nylon was utilized for skin closure.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were warm _______ pulses distally at the end of the case.  The tourniquet as stated has been deflated prior to closure and hemostasis was controlled.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded.",Orthopedic
258,"PROCEDURE:,  Total hip replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.,Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.,The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.,The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.,The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.  The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was closed with nylon.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.",Surgery

Approximately one year ago, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and CT scan at that time showed that he had a hiatal hernia.  Over the past year, this has caused him an increasing number of problems, including chest pain when he eats, and shortness of breath after large meals.  He is also having reflux symptoms again.  He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure.  He was stable at that time.  He did complain of some nausea.  However, he did not have any vomiting at that time.  He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o.  He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol.  On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed.  Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows.  He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting.  Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications.  He ambulated frequently.  He remained n.p.o. for three days.  He also had the NG tube in during that time.  On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued.  He was advanced to a liquid diet and tolerated this without any complications.  At this time, he was still using the PCA for pain control.  However, he was using it much less frequently than on days #1 and #2 postoperatively.  After tolerating the full liquid diet without any complications, he was advanced to a soft diet and his pain medications were transitioned to p.o. medications rather than the PCA.  The PCA was discontinued.  He tolerated the soft diet without any complications and continued to have flatus frequently.  On postoperative day #6, it was determined that he was stable for discharge to home as he was taking p.o. without any complications.  His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain medications.  He was passing gas frequently, had excellent urine output, and was ambulating frequently without any issues.,DISCHARGE CONDITION:,  Stable.,DISPOSITION: , Discharged to home.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , The patient was discharged to home with instructions for maintaining a soft diet.  It was also recommended that he does not drink any soda postoperatively.  He is instructed to keep his incision site clean and dry and it was also recommended that he avoid any heavy lifting.

2776,"Doctor's Address,Dear Doctor:,This letter serves as a reintroduction of my patient, A, who will be seeing you on Thursday, 06/12/2008.  As you know, he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities.  His current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg.  He has been through Wound Clinic to try to help heal this, but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this.  He has been seen by Dr. X for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain.  He was seen by Dr. Y at Orthopedic Associates for review of this.  However, in my discussion with Dr. Z and his evaluation of Mr. A, it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his RST, his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg, and concerns of worsening of his RST symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation.  Based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test, Dr. Z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds.  As you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve Mr. A's pain.  He has been to Cleveland Clinic for implantable stimulator, which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain.  He currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day, morphine up to 100 mg three times a day, and Dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain.  He also is currently taking Neurontin 1600 mg three times a day, Effexor XR 250 mg once a day, Cytomel 25 mcg once a day, Seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day, levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day, Prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day, and Mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day.,I appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation.  Dr. Z and I have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion.  He has been evaluated by Dr. X for rehab concerns to determine.  He agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate.,I thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation.  If you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office.  Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation.  Please feel free to call me if it is possible or if you have any questions about anything.",Neurology

4586,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 91-year-old female who was brought in by family.  Apparently, she was complaining that she felt she might have been poisoned at her care facility.  The daughter who accompanied the patient states that she does not think anything is actually wrong, but she became extremely agitated and she thinks that is the biggest problem with the patient right now.  The patient apparently had a little bit of dry heaves, but no actual vomiting.  She had just finished eating dinner.  No one else in the facility has been ill.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for previous abdominal surgeries.  She has a pacemaker.  She has a history of recent collarbone fracture.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Very difficult to get from the patient herself.  She seems to deny any significant pain or discomfort, but really seems not particularly intent on letting me know what is bothering her.  She initially stated that everything was wrong, but could not specify any specific complaints.  Denies chest pain, back pain, or abdominal pain.  Denies any extremity symptoms or complaints.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker.  She is accompanied here with daughter who brought her over here.  They were visiting the patient when this episode occurred.,MEDICATIONS:  Please see list.,ALLERGIES:  NONE.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile, actually has a very normal vital signs including normal pulse oximetry at 99% on room air.  GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly frail looking little lady lying on the gurney.  She is awake, alert, and not really wanted to answer most of the questions I asked her.  She does have a tremor with her mouth, which the daughter states has been there for ""many years"".  HEENT:  Eye exam is unremarkable.  Oral mucosa is still moist and well hydrated.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS:  Actually clear with good breath sounds.  There are no wheezes, no rales, or rhonchi.  Good air movement.  CARDIAC:  Without murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft.  I do not elicit any tenderness.  There is no abdominal distention.  Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants.  SKIN:  Skin is without rash or petechiae.  There is no cyanosis.  EXTREMITIES:  No evidence of any trauma to the extremities.,EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  I had a long discussion with the family and they would like the patient receive something for agitation, so she was given 0.5 mg of Ativan intramuscularly.  After about half an hour, I came back to talk to the patient and the family, the patient states that she feels better.  Family states she seems more calm.  They do not want to pursue any further workup at this time.,IMPRESSION:  ACUTE EPISODE OF AGITATION.,PLAN:  At this time, I had reviewed the patient's records and it is not particularly enlightening as to what could have triggered off this episode.  The patient herself has good vital signs.  She does not seem to have any specific acute process going on and seemed to feel comfortable after the Ativan was given, a small quantity was given to the patient.  Family and daughter specifically did not want to pursue any workup at this point, which at this point I think is reasonable and we will have her follow up with ABC.  She is discharged in stable condition.",Consult - History and Phy.

Prior to starting the procedure, the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.  Subsequently, she was given a bronchodilator treatment with Atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90% to 91% on room air.,The patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above-stated medication.  As this occurred, the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  The cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation.  There was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side.  Additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords, at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea, which was midline in nature.  The bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this time, the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  At this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  At this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  At this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,At this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  Additional lidocaine was instilled.  The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  There was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  At this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  During the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  She was advised regarding smoking cessation.  The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  The patient was also administered Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room.  There was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  At this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to ABCD Emergency Room for evaluation of possible admission.  However, the above was reviewed with the patient in great detail as well as with her daughter and mother who were at the bedsite at this time as well.",Surgery

New right hydronephrosis.,3.  Carcinoid tumor of the small bowel.,TITLE OF OPERATION: , Exploratory laparotomy, resection of small bowel lesion, biopsy of small bowel mesentery, bilateral extended pelvic and iliac lymphadenectomy (including preaortic and precaval, bilateral common iliac, presacral, bilateral external iliac lymph nodes), salvage radical cystoprostatectomy (very difficult due to previous chemotherapy and radiation therapy), and continent urinary diversion with an Indiana pouch.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal and epidural.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 65-year-old white male, who was diagnosed with a high-grade invasive bladder cancer in June 2005.  During the course of his workup of transurethral resection, he had a heart attack when he was taken off Plavix after having had a drug-eluting stent placed in.  He recovered from this and then underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy with a brief response documented by cystoscopy and biopsy after which he had another ischemic event.  The patient has been followed regularly by myself and Dr. X and has been continuously free of diseases since that time.  In that interval, he had a coronary artery bypass graft and was taken off of Plavix.  Most recently, he had a PET CT, which showed new right hydronephrosis and a followup cystoscopy, which showed a new abnormality in the right side of his bladder where he previously had the tumor resected and treated.  I took him to the operating room and extensively resected this area with findings of a high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer.  We could not identify the right ureteral orifice, and he had a right ureteral stent placed.  Metastatic workup was negative and Cardiology felt he was at satisfactory medical risk for surgery and he was taken to the operating room this time for planned salvage cystoprostatectomy.  He was interested in orthotopic neobladder, and I felt like that would be reasonable if resecting around the urethra indicated the tissue was healthier.  Therefore, we planned on an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,On exploration, there were multiple abnormalities outside the bladder as follows:  There were at least three small lesions within the distal small bowel, the predominant one measured about 1.5 cm in diameter with a white scar on the surface.  There were two much smaller lesions also with a small white scar, with very little palpable mass.  The larger of the two was resected and found to be a carcinoid tumor.  There also were changes in the small bowel mesentry that looked inflammatory and biopsies of this showed only fibrous tissue and histiocytes.  The small bowel mesentry was fairly thickened at the base, but no discrete abnormality noted.,Both common iliac and lymph node samples were very thickened and indurated, and frozen section of the left showed cancer cells that were somewhat degenerative suggesting a chemotherapy and radiation therapy effect; viability was unable to be determined.  There was a frozen section of the distal right external iliac lymph node that was negative.  The bladder was very thickened and abnormal suggesting extensive cancer penetrating just under the peritoneal surface.  The bladder was fairly stuck to the pelvic sidewall and anterior symphysis pubis requiring very meticulous resection in order to get it off of these structures.  The external iliac lymph nodes were resected on both sides of the obturator; the lymph packet, however, was very stuck and adherent to the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove that.  The rest of the large bowel appeared normal.  There were no masses in the liver, and the gallbladder was surgically absent.  There was nasogastric tube in the stomach.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, having placed in the supine position and flexed over the anterior superior iliac spine, his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The radiologist placed a radial arterial line and an intravenous catheter.  Intravenous antibiotics were given for prophylaxis.  We made a generous midline skin incision from high end of the epigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deepened through the rectus fascia, and the rectus muscles separated in the midline.  Exploration was carried out with the findings described.  The bladder was adherent and did appear immobile.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor was placed for exposure.  We began by assessing the small and large bowel with the findings in the small bowel as described.  We subsequently resected the largest of the lesions by exogenous wedge resection and reanastomosed the small bowel with a two-layer running 4-0 Prolene suture.  We then mobilized the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure after incising the white line of Toldt and mobilized the terminal ileal mesentery up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureters were carefully dissected out and down deep in the true pelvis.  The right ureter was thickened and hydronephrotic with a stent in place and the left was of normal caliber.  I kept the ureters intact until we were moving the bladder off as described above.  At that point, we then ligated the ureters with the RP-45 vascular load and divided it.,We then established the proximal ____________ laterally to both genitofemoral nerves and resected the precaval and periaortic lymph nodes.  The common iliac lymph nodes remained stuck to the ureter.  Frozen section with the findings described on the left.,I then began the dissection over the right external iliac artery and vein and had a great deal of difficulty dissecting distally.  I was, however, able to establish the distal plane of dissection and a large lymph node was present in the distal external iliac vessels.  Clips were used to control the lymphatics distally.  These lymph nodes were sent for frozen section, which was negative.  We made no attempt to circumferentially mobilize the vessels, but essentially, swept the tissue off of the anterior surface and towards the bladder and then removed it.  The obturator nerve on the right side was sucked into the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove those.  On the left side, things were a little bit more mobile in terms of the lymph nodes, but still the obturator lymph nodes were left intact.,We then worked on the lateral pedicles on both sides and essentially determined that I can take these down.  I then mobilized the later half of the symphysis pubis and pubic ramus to get distal to the apical prostate.  At this point, I scrubbed out of the operation, talked to the family, and indicated that I felt the cystectomy was more palliative than therapeutic, and I reiterated his desire to be free of any external appliance.,I then proceeded to take down the lateral pedicles with an RP-45 stapler on the right and clips distally.  The endopelvic fascia was incised.  I then turned my attention posteriorly and incised the peritoneum overlying the anterior rectal wall and ramus very meticulously dissected the rectum away from the posterior Denonvilliers fascia.  I intentionally picked down those two pedicles lateral to the rectum between the clips and then turned my attention retropubically.  I was able to pass a 0 Vicryl suture along the dorsal venous complex, tied this, and then, sealed and divided the complex with a LigaSure and oversewed it distally with 2-0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch.  I then divided the urethra distal to the apex of the prostate, divided the Foley catheter between the clamps and then the posterior urethra.  I then was able to take down the remaining distal attachments of the apex and took the dissection off the rectum, and the specimen was then free of all attachments and handed off the operative field.  The bivalved prostate appeared normal.  We then carefully inspected the rectal wall and noted to be intact.  The wound was irrigated with 1 L of warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection made for hemostasis and a dry pack placed in the pelvis.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stoma and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,The stoma was returned to the umbilicus after resecting the terminal ileum.,We then placed a large JP drain into both obturator fossae and brought it up the right lower quadrant.  Rectus fascia was closed with buried #2 Prolene stitch anchoring a new figure of 8 at each end tying the two stitches above and in the middle and underneath the fascia.  Interrupted stitches were placed as well.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and skin closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 2500 mL.  The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of FFP.  The patient was then awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",Urology

1044,"PROCEDURE:, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:, Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla.,MEDICATIONS:, General anesthesia.,The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.,FINDINGS:,1.

3108,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 55-year-old woman with carcinoma of the cervix metastatic to retroperitoneum, lung, which was diagnosed approximately two years ago.  There is a nodule in her lung, which was treated by excision in February of 2007 on the right side.  She had spread to her kidney.  She had right-sided nephrectomy and left-sided nephrostomy.  She also had invasion of the bladder.  Currently, all of her urine comes out through the renal nephrostomy.  She complains of burning vaginal pain, as well as chronic discharge, which has improved slightly recently.  She is not able to engage in intercourse because of the pain and bleeding.  She also has pain with bowel movements, as well as painful urgency.  The pain is at least 3-4/10 and is partially relieved with methadone rescues and interferes with her ability to sleep at night as she feels exhausted and tired.  She has some nausea and diminished appetite.  No hallucinations.  She is anxious frequently and this is helped with clonazepam, which she has taken chronically for her anxiety disorder and recently started Zyprexa.  She has occasional shortness of breath, which used to be helped with oxygen in the hospital.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Peptic ulcer disease, hypertension.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  She has constipation with hard bowel movements.,MEDICATIONS:,  Norvasc 10 mg daily, isosorbide 60 mg every 24 hours, olanzapine at 2.5-5 mg in bedtime, clonazepam 1 mg every eight hours, Sorbitol 30 cc twice a day, Senna-S two tabs daily, methadone 60 mg every eight hours, and 30 mg every four hours p.r.n. pain.,ALLERGIES:,  She has no known allergies.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with her common law husband and her daughter.

4264,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Neurologic consultation was requested by Dr. X to evaluate her seizure medication and lethargy.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is well known to me.  She has symptomatic partial epilepsy secondary to a static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, and shunted hydrocephalus related to prematurity.  She also has a history of factor V Leiden deficiency.  She was last seen at neurology clinic on 11/16/2007.  At that time, instructions were given to mom to maximize her Trileptal dose if seizures continue.  She did well on 2 mL twice a day without any sedation.  This past Friday, she had a 25-minute seizure reportedly.  This consisted of eye deviation, unresponsiveness, and posturing.  Diastat was used and which mom perceived was effective.  Her Trileptal dose was increased to 3 mL b.i.d. yesterday.,According to mom since her shunt revision on 12/18/2007, she has been sleepier than normal.  She appeared to be stable until this past Monday about six days ago, she became more lethargic and had episodes of vomiting and low-grade fevers.  According to mom, she had stopped vomiting since her hospitalization.  Reportedly, she was given a medication in the emergency room.  She still is lethargic, will not wake up spontaneously.  When she does awaken however, she is appropriate, and interacts with them.  She is able to eat well; however her overall p.o. intake has been diminished.  She has also been less feisty as her usual sounds.  She has been seizure free since her admission.,LABORATORY DATA: , Pertinent labs obtained here showed the following:  CRP is less than 0.3, CMP normal, and CBC within normal limits.  CSF cultures so far is negative.  Dr. Limon's note refers to a CSF, white blood cell count of 2, 1 RBC, glucose of 55, and protein of 64.  There are no imaging studies in the computer.  I believe that this may have been done at Kaweah Delta Hospital and reviewed by Dr. X, who indicated that there was no evidence of shunt malfunction or infection.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Trileptal 180 mg b.i.d., lorazepam 1 mg p.r.n., acetaminophen, and azithromycin.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient was asleep, but easily aroused.  There was a brief period of drowsiness, which she had some jerky limb movements, but not seizures.  She eventually started crying and became agitated.  She made attempts to sit by bending her neck forward.  Fully awake, she sucks her bottle eagerly.,HEENT:  She was obviously visually impaired.  Pupils were 3 mm, sluggishly reactive to light.,EXTREMITIES:  Bilateral lower extremity spasticity was noted.  There was increased flexor tone in the right upper extremity.  IV was noted on the left hand.,ASSESSMENT:  ,Seizure breakthrough due to intercurrent febrile illness.  Her lethargy could be secondary to a viral illness with some component of medication effect since her Trileptal dose was increased yesterday and these are probable explanations if indeed shunt malfunction has been excluded.,I concur with Dr. X's recommendations.  I do not recommend any changes in Trileptal for now.  I will be available while she remains hospitalized.,",Consult - History and Phy.

Excision of right breast lateral lesion enclosure.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DRAINS:,  None.,SPECIMENS:,  Right breast skin and lesions x2.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,INDICATIONS:,  This patient is a 54-year-old white female who presents for a revision of her previous bilateral breast reconstruction.  The patient had asymmetry as well as right breast hypertrophy, and therefore, the procedures named above were indicated.  The patient was informed about the possible risks and complications of the above procedures and gave an informed consent.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operative table.  After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was established and IV prophylactic antibiotics were given, the chest and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.,Attention was first turned to the left breast where liposuction was performed laterally to allow for better contour and minimize the outer quadrant.  The incision was made for this and was then closed with 5-0 Prolene interrupted suture.,Attention was then turned to the right breast where liposuction was also performed to reduce the medial superior and lateral quadrants.  Once this was performed, the vertical reduction mammoplasty was outlined.  Prior to that, the nipple reconstruction was performed with a keyhole pattern flap.  The flap was elevated with 15-blade and hemostasis was then obtained with the Bovie.  The flap was then sutured onto itself and secured with 5-0 Prolene interrupted sutures.  Then the lateral and medial limbs were undermined to close the defect and this was performed with 3-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures.  Subsequently, the reduction mastectomy skin was then excised sharply and passed up the table marked and sent to Pathology. ,Hemostasis was then obtained with the Bovie and then undermining was performed in the medial, superior, and lateral skin to allow for closure of the reduction incisions.  Once this was performed, a 3-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures were used to close the inferior limb.  Subsequently 2-0 PDS continuous suture was then placed in the periareolar area to close the defect, with a diameter that equaled the new nipple areolar complex.  Once this was performed, the remaining incision was then closed with 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Subsequently, the 2 lesions were excised, the larger one which was medial and the lateral one that was smaller that were excised sharply, passed up the table and sent to Pathology.  They were closed in 2 layers using 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.,Attention was then turned to the abdominal scars where liposuction and tumescent solution of diluted epinephrine were used to minimize the amount of excision that was required.  Subsequently the extra skin was excised sharply in an elliptical fashion on the right side measuring approximately 10 x 3 cm, this was the superior and inferior skin, was when undermined and closure was performed after hemostasis was obtained with 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.,Attention was then turned to the contralateral left side where there was a larger defect.  There was a larger excision required measuring approximately 15 x 3 cm.  The superior and inferior edges of skin were undermined and closed primarily using 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Steri-Strips were placed on all incisions followed by surgical bra.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated without complications and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  All instruments, needle counts, and sponges were correct at the end of the case.",Surgery

The patient was brought to the minor procedure area and sedated per their protocol.  The patient was positioned lying supine.  Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine.  The obturator nerves were identified lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 7 mL was injected on the right side and 5 mL on the left side.  At all sites of phenol injections in this area injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus.  Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol.  The musculocutaneous nerve was identified in the left upper extremity above the brachial pulse using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 5 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location.  Injections in this area were done at the site of maximum elbow flexion contraction with least amount of stimulus.  Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol.,Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified using active EMG stimulation.  Approximately 150 units was injected in the knee extensors bilaterally, 100 units in the left pectoralis major, and 50 units in the left wrist flexors.  Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 450 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered.",Surgery

Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement.,ANESTHESIA: , Sedation.,SPECIMEN: , Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies.,INDICATION:,  The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria.  He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder.  The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder.  There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed.  Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side.  At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire.  The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.  The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis.  The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room.  It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy.  He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.",Nephrology
1985,"NAME OF PROCEDURE:,  Hypogastric plexus block.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was used to make a skin wheal 8-10 cm lateral to the L4 spinous process bilaterally from the midline.  Starting from the left side, a 20-gauge 6-inch needle was placed to the left L5-S1 facet level under AP fluoroscopic view.  On lateral view, the tip of the needle was at the inferior one-third of the LS vertebral body, anterior aspect.  Next 5 cc of Omnipaque dye was injection showing a linear spread along the anterior portion of L5 down the sacral promontory.  After negative aspiration 18 cc of 0.25% Marcaine plus 40 mg of Depo-Medrol was injection.  There were no complications.  The above sequence was repeated for the right side.

Complex renal cyst versus renal cell carcinoma or other tumor.,4. Osteoarthritis.,HOSPITAL COURSE:, This is a 77-year-old African-American male who was previously well until he began having gross hematuria and clots passing through his urethra on the day of admission. He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended.,He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge.,He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:, Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d.,DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING:, The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of  Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week.

3484,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,  The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice.  He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.  At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000.  His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3.  His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8.  He was tolerating a regular diet.  The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale.  The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary.  He will be further managed for his diabetes there.  The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings.  I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient.  Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity.  The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X.  ,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.  Phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n.,2.  Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d.,3.  Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus.,4.  Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary.,5.  The patient had initially been on enalapril here.  His hypertension will be managed by Dr. X as well.  ,PLAN: , The patient should return for repeat ERCP if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever, increased bilirubin, worsening pain.  In the meantime, he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per Dr. X.",Gastroenterology
3133,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  New diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage IV metastatic disease.  We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.,ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation.  On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region.  There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  All other structures appeared normal.  On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.,On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.  He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough.  He has no sputum production or hemoptysis.  He and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , He denies having any surgeries.,ALLERGIES: , No known drug allergies.,MEDICATIONS:,  At home he takes no medication except occasional aspirin or ibuprofen, recently for his flank pain.  He does take a multivitamin on occasion.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has about a 30-pack-a-year history of smoking.  He used to drink alcohol heavily and has a history of getting a DUI about a year-and-half ago resulting in him having his truck-driving license revoked.  Since that time he has worked with printing press.  He is married and has two children, both of whom are grown in their 20s, but are now living at home.,FAMILY HISTORY: , His mother died for alcohol-related complications.

He has been somewhat constipated recently.  GU:  He denies any burning with urination, kidney stones, blood in his urine, dysuria, difficulty getting his urine out or other problems.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  He denies any new bony aches or pains including back pain, hip pain, and rib pain.  No muscle aches, no joint swelling, and no history of gout.  SKIN:  No rashes, no bruising, petechia, non-healing wounds, or ulcerations.  He has had no nail or hair changes.  HEM:  He denies any bloody nose, bleeding gums, easy bruising, easy bleeding, swollen lymphs or bumps.

NEURO:  He denies any mental status changes, anxiety, confusion, depression, hallucinations, loss of feeling in her arm or leg, numbness or tingling in hands or feet, loss of balance, syncope, seizures, or loss of coordination.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION,VITAL SIGNS:  His T-max is 98.8.  His pulse is 85, respirations 18, and blood pressure 126/80 saturating over 90% on room air.,GENERAL:  No acute distress, pleasant gentleman who appears stated age.,HEENT:  NC/AT.  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctiva clear.  Oropharynx is clear without erythema, exudate, or discharge.,NECK:  Supple.  Nontender.  No elevated JVP.  No carotid bruits.  No thyromegaly.

He has 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally in the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankle reflexes.  He is alert and oriented x3.,LABORATORY DATA: , His white blood cell count is 9.4, hemoglobin 13.0, hematocrit 38%, and platelets 365,000.  The differential shows 73% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 7.6% monocytes, 1.9% eosinophils, and 0.7% basophils.  Chemistry shows sodium 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 of 31, BUN 9, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104, calcium 12.3, alkaline phosphatase 104, AST 16, ALT 12, total protein 7.6, albumin 3.5, total bilirubin 0.5, ionized calcium 1.7.  His INR is 1.0 with the PT of 11.4 and a PTT of 31.3.,IMAGINING DATA:,  MRI of the brain on 12/23/08 - this shows some mild white matter disease, question of minimal pontine ischemic gliosis as well as a small incidental venous angioma in the left posterior frontal deep white matter.  There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.,In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.,In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging.  A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.,At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday.  At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.,Thank you very much for this interesting consult.",Hematology - Oncology

Post-fixation x-rays, nonalignment, no new changes.  Post-fixation neurologic examination normal.,CLINICAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy.  She was referred to me by Dr. X.  The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate.  Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.,The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.,The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.  Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery.  She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course.,The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.",Neurosurgery

No focal muscle weakness.  She is deconditioned.,Neurologic:  She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect.  The patient has normal tone and coordination.  Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles.  Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick.,Spine:  Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement.  The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints.,FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: , Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.,INVESTIGATION: , She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally.  She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally.  CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease.  CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease.  MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs.  CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases.  CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan.  MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes.,IMPRESSION:,1.  Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs.,2.  Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right.,3.  Chronic pain syndrome.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology.  Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right.  Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today.  I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed.  She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this.  We have asked for stat protime today.  She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications.  She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms.  Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed.  I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday.  I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead.  She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan.  I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation.  Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings.  Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments.",Consult - History and Phy.

2380,"SCLERAL BUCKLE OPENING,The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  General anesthesia was induced by the anesthesiologist.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.  A 360-degree limbal conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors.  Curved tenotomy scissors were used to enter each of the intermuscular quadrants.  The inferior rectus muscle was isolated with a muscle hook, freed of its Tenon's attachment and tied with a 2-0 silk suture.  The 3 other rectus muscles were isolated in a similar fashion.  The 4 scleral quadrants were inspected and found to be free of scleral thinning or staphyloma.",Ophthalmology
4198,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,This is a 53-year-old man, who presented to emergency room with multiple complaints including pain from his hernia, some question of blood in his stool, nausea, and vomiting, and also left lower extremity pain.  At the time of my exam, he states that his left lower extremity pain has improved considerably.  He apparently had more significant paresthesias in the past and now he feels that the paresthesias have improved considerably.  He does have a history of multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, he is on Coumadin, which is currently subtherapeutic, multiple CVAs in the past, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure.  He has multiple chronic history of previous ischemia of his large bowel in the past.,PHYSICAL EXAM,VITAL SIGNS:  Currently his temperature is 98.2, pulse is 95, and blood pressure is 138/98.,HEENT:  Unremarkable.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  An irregular rhythm.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.,EXTREMITIES:  His upper extremities are well perfused.  He has palpable radial and femoral pulses.  He does not have any palpable pedal pulses in either right or left lower extremity.  He does have reasonable capillary refill in both feet.  He has about one second capillary refill on both the right hand and left lower extremities and his left foot is perhaps little cool, but it is relatively warm.  Apparently, this was lot worst few hours ago.  He describes significant pain and pallor, which he feels has improved and certainly clinically at this point does not appear to be as significant.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: , This gentleman with a history of multiple comorbidities as detailed above had what sounds clinically like acute exacerbation of chronic peripheral vascular disease, essentially related to spasm versus a small clot, which may have been lysed to some extent.  He currently has a viable extremity and viable foot, but certainly has significant making compromised flow.  It is unclear to me whether this is chronic or acute, and whether he is a candidate for any type of intervention.  He certainly would benefit from an angiogram to better to define his anatomy and anticoagulation in the meantime.  Given his potential history of recent lower GI bleeding, he has been evaluated by GI to see whether or not he is a candidate for heparinization.  We will order an angiogram for the next few hours and followup on those results to better define his anatomy and to determine whether or not if any interventions are appropriate.  Again, at this point, he has no pain, relatively rapid capillary refill, and relatively normal motor function suggesting a viable extremity.  We will follow him along closely.",Consult - History and Phy.

Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.  The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The area was marked with a marking pen with margins of 3 to 4 mm, and a #15 Bard-Parker blade was used to make an incision at the nasal and temporal margins of the lesion.,The incision was carried inferiorly, and using a Steven scissors the normal skin, muscle, and conjunctiva was excised inferiorly.  The specimen was then marked and sent to pathology for frozen section.  Bleeding was controlled with a wet-field cautery, and the right upper lid was everted, and an incision was made 3 mm above the lid margin with the Bard-Parker blade in the entire length of the upper lid.  The incision reached the orbicularis, and Steven scissors were used to separate the tarsus from the underlying orbicularis.  Vertical cuts were made nasally and temporally, and a large dorsal conjunctival flap was fashioned with the conjunctiva attached superiorly.  It was placed into the defect in the lower lid and sutured with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures nasally, temporally, and inferiorly.,The defect in the skin was measured and an appropriate large preauricular graft was excised from the right preauricular region.  The defect was closed with interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures, and the preauricular graft was sutured in place with multiple interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  The upper border of the graft was attached to the upper lid after incision was made in the gray line with a Superblade, and the superior portion of the skin graft was sutured to the upper lid through the anterior lamella created by the razor blade incision.,Cryotherapy was then used to treat the nasal and temporal margins of the area of excision because of positive margins, and following this an antibiotic steroid ointment was instilled and a light pressure dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in good condition.",Ophthalmology
946,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Prostatism.,2.  Bladder calculus.,OPERATION:,  Holmium laser cystolithalopaxy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Prostatism.,2.  Bladder calculus.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,INDICATIONS:,  This is a 62-year-old male diabetic and urinary retention with apparent neurogenic bladder and intermittent self-catheterization, recent urinary tract infections.  The cystoscopy showed a large bladder calculus, short but obstructing prostate.  He comes in now for transurethral resection of his prostate and holmium laser cystolithotripsy.,He is a diabetic with obesity.,LABORATORY DATA:  ,Includes urinalysis showing white cells too much to count, 3-5 red cells, occasional bacteria.  He had a serum creatinine of 1.2, sodium 138, potassium 4.6, glucose 190, calcium 9.1.  Hematocrit 40.5, hemoglobin 13.8, white count 7,900.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia.  Prepped and draped in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 27-French Olympus rectoscope was passed via the urethra into the bladder.  The bladder, prostate, and urethra were inspected.  He had an obstructing prostate.  He had marked catheter reaction in his bladder.  He had a lot of villous changes, impossible to tell from frank tumor.  He had a huge bladder calculus.  It was white and round.,I used the holmium laser with the largest fiber through the continuous flow resectoscope and sheath, and broke up the stone, breaking up approximately 40 grams of stone.  There was still stone left at the end of the procedure.  Most of the chips that could be irrigated out of the bladder were irrigated out using Ellik.,Then the scope was removed and a 24-French 3-way Foley catheter was passed via the urethra into the bladder.,The plan is to probably discharge the patient in the morning and then we will get a KUB.  We will probably bring him back for a second stage cystolithotripsy, and ultimately do a TURP.  We broke up the stone for over an hour, and my judgment continuing with litholapaxy transurethrally over an hour begins to markedly increase the risk to the patient.",Surgery
1279,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Abdominal wall abscess.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Abdominal wall abscess.,PROCEDURE: , Incision and drainage (I&D) of abdominal abscess, excisional debridement of nonviable and viable skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle, then removal of foreign body.,ANESTHESIA: , LMA.,INDICATIONS: , Patient is a pleasant 60-year-old gentleman, who initially had a sigmoid colectomy for diverticular abscess, subsequently had a dehiscence with evisceration.  Came in approximately 36 hours ago with pain across his lower abdomen.  CT scan demonstrated presence of an abscess beneath the incision.  I recommended to the patient he undergo the above-named procedure.  Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternatives forms of therapy were discussed with him, and he was agreeable to surgery.,FINDINGS:,  The patient was found to have an abscess that went down to the level of the fascia.  The anterior layer of the fascia was fibrinous and some portions necrotic.  This was excisionally debrided using the Bovie cautery, and there were multiple pieces of suture within the wound and these were removed as well.,TECHNIQUE:  ,Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in a sterile fashion.  The wound opening where it was draining was explored using a curette.  The extent of the wound marked with a marking pen and using the Bovie cautery, the abscess was opened and drained.  I then noted that there was a significant amount of undermining.  These margins were marked with a marking pen, excised with Bovie cautery; the curette was used to remove the necrotic fascia.  The wound was irrigated; cultures sent prior to irrigation and after achievement of excellent hemostasis, the wound was packed with antibiotic-soaked gauze.  A dressing was applied.  The finished wound size was 9.0 x 5.3 x 5.2 cm in size.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  Dressing was applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition.",Surgery

Preparation was good, although there was some residual material in the cecum that was difficult to clear completely.  The mucosa was normal throughout the colon.  No polyps or other lesions were identified, and no blood was noted.  Some diverticula were seen of the sigmoid colon with no luminal narrowing or evidence of inflammation.  A retroflex view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Diverticulosis in the sigmoid.,2.

Posterior spinal instrumentation from T2-L2.,3.  A posterior osteotomy through T7-T8 and T8-T9.  Posterior elements to include laminotomy-foraminotomy and decompression of the nerve roots.,IMPLANT: , Sofamor Danek (Medtronic) Legacy 5.5 Titanium system.,MONITORING: , SSEPs, and the EPs were available.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 12-year-old female, who has had a very dysmorphic scoliosis.  She had undergone a workup with an MRI, which showed no evidence of cord abnormalities.  Therefore, the risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with Surgery with the mother, to include infections, bleeding, nerve injuries, vascular injuries, spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control.  I also discussed ___________ and need for revision surgery.  The mom understood all this and wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic.  She then had lines placed, and was then placed in a prone position.  Monitoring was then set up, and it was then noted that we could not obtain motor-evoked potentials.  The SSEPs were clear and were compatible with the preoperative, but no preoperative motors had been done, and there was a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning.  It was then determined at that time, that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up, and make sure she could move her feet.  She was then lightened under anesthesia, and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her feet, so therefore, it was determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the SSEPs.,The patient after being prepped and draped sterilely, a midline incision was made, and dissection was carried down.  The dissection utilized a combination of hand instruments and electrocautery and dissected out along the laminae and up to the transverse processes.  This occurred from T2-L2.  Fluoroscopy was brought in to verify positions and levels.  Once this was done, and all bleeding was controlled, retractors were then placed.  Attention was then turned towards placing screws first on the left side.  Lumbar screws were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facets under fluoroscopic guidance.  The area was opened with a high speed burr, and then the track was defined with a blunt probe, and a ball-tipped feeler was then utilized to verify all walls were intact.  They were then tapped, and then screws were then placed.  This technique was used at L1 and L2, both the right and left.  At T12, a direct straight-ahead technique was utilized, where the facet was removed, and then the position was chosen under the fluoroscopy, and then it was spurred, the track was defined and then probed and tapped, and it was felt to be in good position.  Two screws, in the right and left were placed at T12 as well, reduction screws on the left.  The same technique was used for T11, where right and left screws were placed as well as T10 on the left.  At T9, a screw was placed on the left, and this was a reduction screw.  On the left at T8, a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle.  It was not felt to be intact; therefore, a screw was left out of this.  On the right, a thoracic screw was placed as well as at 7 and 6.  This was the dysmorphic portion of this.  Screws were attempted to be placed up, they could not be placed, so attention was then turned towards placing pedicle hooks.  Pedicle hooks were done by first making a box out of the pedicle, removing the complete pedicle, feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe, and then seating the hook.  Upgoing pedicle hooks were placed at T3, T4, and T5.  A downgoing laminar hook was placed at the T7 level.  Screws had been placed at T6 and T7 on the right.  An upgoing pedicle hook was also placed at T3 on the right, and then, downgoing laminar hooks were placed at T2.  This was done by first using a transverse process, lamina finders to go around the transverse process and then ___________ laminar hooks.  Once all hooks were in place, spinal osteotomies were performed at T7-T8 and T8-T9.  This was the level of the kyphosis, to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis.  First the ligamentum flavum was resected using a large Kerrisons.  Next, the laminotomy was performed, and then a Kerrison was used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet.  Once this was accomplished, a laminotomy was performed by removing more of the lamina, and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis.  This was then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen, doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both sides.  This was done also between the T8-T9.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was then placed.  Next, we observed, and measured and contoured.  The rods were then seated on the left, and then a derotation maneuver was performed.  Hooks had come loose, so the rod was removed on the left.  The hooks were then replaced, and the rod was reseated.  Again, it was derotated to give excellent correction.  Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.  A second rod was then chosen on the right, and was measured, contoured, and then seated.  Next, once this was done, the rods were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 was then helped to compress T8 as was the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy sites quite nicely.  Next, distraction was then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.  On the right, compression was used to bring it down, and then, in the lower lumbar areas, distraction and compression were used to level out L2.  Once this was done, all screws were tightened.  Fluoroscopy was then brought in to verify L1 was level, and the first ribs were also level, and it gave a nice balanced spine.  Everything was copiously irrigated, ___________.  Next, a wake-up test was performed, and the patient was then noted to flex and extend the knees as well as dorsiflex and plantar flex both the feet.  The patient was then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia.  Next, a high-speed burr was used for decortication.  After final tightening had been accomplished, and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 mL of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound.  The open canal areas had been protected with Gelfoam.  Once this was accomplished, the deep fascia was closed with multiple figure-of-eight #1's, oversewn with a running #1, _________ were then placed in the subcutaneous spaces which were then closed with 3-0 Vicryl, and then the skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Drains had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2.  The patient during the case had no changes in the SSEPs, had a normal wake-up test, and had received Ancef and clindamycin during the case.  She was taken from the operating room in good condition.",Orthopedic

1099,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1. Left heart catheterization with coronary angiography, vein graft angiography and left ventricular pressure measurement and angiography.,2. Right femoral selective angiogram.,3. Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: ,The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.,CONCLUSION:, 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,PLAN:, The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.,After her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month.

Fusion C3-C4 and C2-C3 with instrumentation using ABC plates.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy.  A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate.  We placed in self-retaining retractors.  With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5.  After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal.  In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit.  It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis.  With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4.  We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4.  These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase.  We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves.  The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin.  Blood loss was about 50 mL.  No complication of the surgery.  Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb.  At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation.  At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain.  He does have degenerative changes at C5-C6, C6-C7, C7-T1; however, they do not appear to be symptomatic, although x-rays show the disks to be partially collapsed at all levels with osteophyte formation beginning to form.",Orthopedic
760,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Osteomyelitis, left hallux.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED: , Resection of infected bone, left hallux, proximal phalanx, and distal phalanx.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/Local.,HISTORY:,  This 77-year-old male presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping himself NPO since mid night for surgery on his infected left hallux.  The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a ""floppy tail"" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound's bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  He is to follow up with Dr. X.  He was given emergency contact numbers.  He is to continue the Vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home.  The patient was discharged in stable condition.",Surgery
3799,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Central neck reoperation with removal of residual metastatic lymphadenopathy and thyroid tissue in the central neck.  Left reoperative neck dissection levels 1 and the infraclavicular fossa on the left side.  Right levels 2 through 5 neck dissection and superior mediastinal dissection of lymph nodes and pretracheal dissection of lymph nodes in a previously operative field.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is a 37-year-old gentleman well known to me with a history of medullary thyroid cancer sporadic in nature having undergone surgery in 04/07 with final pathology revealing extrafocal, extrathyroidal extension, and extranodal extension in the soft tissues of his medullary thyroid cancer.  The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease.  Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed.  The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others.  The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon.  The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine.  Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately.  A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip.  The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised.  A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied.  The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left.  Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible.  The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve.  Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric.  The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally.  The mylohyoid muscle appreciated.  The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated.  The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis.  The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure.  Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side.  Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified.  The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified.  The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels.  Attention was then turned to the central neck.  The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline.  There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature.  A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed.  Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side.  This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein.  Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass.  Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis.  Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection.  A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius.  The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland.  A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated.  The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly.  Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified.  The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle.  Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex.  Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization.  The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass.  Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated.  The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly.  The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  No bleeding points identified.  The wound was then prepared for closure.  Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was closed  with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated on the operating room table, and sent to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.",Endocrinology

The patient was requesting postpartum tubal ligation and removal of a large mole at the junction of her abdomen and left lower rib cage at the skin level.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a seated position with spinal form of anesthesia administered by anesthesia department.  The patient was then repositioned in a supine position and then prepped and draped in the usual fashion for postpartum tubal ligation.  Subumbilical ridge was created using two Ellis and first knife was used to make a transverse incision.  The Ellis were removed and used to be grasped incisional edges and both blunt and sharp dissection down to the level of the fascia was then completed.  The fascia grasped with two Kocher's and then sharply incised and then peritoneum was entered with use of blunt dissection.  Two Army-Navy retractors were put in place and a vein retractor was used to grasp the left fallopian tube and then regrasped with Babcock's and followed to the fimbriated end.  A modified Pomeroy technique was completed with double tying of with 0 chromic, then upper portion was sharply incised and the cut fallopian tube edges were then cauterized.  Adequate hemostasis was noted.  This tube was placed back in its anatomic position.  The right fallopian tube was grasped followed to its fimbriated end and then regrasped with a Babcock and a modified Pomeroy technique was also completed on the right side, and upper portion was then sharply incised and the cut edges re-cauterized with adequate hemostasis and this was placed back in its anatomic position.  The peritoneum as well as fascia was reapproximated with 0-Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl and skin edges reapproximated with 4-0 Vicryl as well in a subcuticular stitch.  Pressure dressings were applied.  Marcaine 10 mL was used prior to making an incision.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The large mole-like lesion was grasped with Allis.  It was approximately 1 cm x 0.5 cm in size and an elliptical incision was made around the mass and cut edges were cauterized and 4-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the skin edges and pressure dressing was also applied.

Prior cerebrovascular accident.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,250 cc.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The common and internal carotid arteries were opened.  A high-grade narrowing was present at the proximal internal carotid and this tapered well to a slightly small diameter internal carotid.  This was repaired with a Dacron patch and the patient tolerated this well under regional anesthetic without need for shunting.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  Longitudinal incisions were made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, carried down through subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The platysmal muscle was divided.  The carotid sheath was identified and opened.  The vagus nerve, ansa cervicalis, and hypoglossal nerves were identified and avoided.  The common internal and external carotids were then freed from the surrounding tissue.  At this point, 10,000 units of aqueous heparin were administered and allowed to take effect.  The external and common carotids were then clamped.  The patient's neurological status was evaluated and found to be unchanged from preoperative levels.,Once sufficient time had lapsed, we proceeded with the procedure.  The carotid bulb was opened with a #11 blade and extended with Potts scissors through the very tight lesion into normal internal carotid.  The plaque was then sharply excised proximally and an eversion endarterectomy was performed successfully at the external.  The plaque tapered nicely on the internal and no tacking sutures were necessary.  Heparinized saline was injected and no evidence of flapping or other debris was noted.  The remaining carotid was examined under magnification, which showed no debris of flaps present.  At this point, a Dacron patch was brought on to the field, cut to appropriate length and size, and anastomosed to the artery using #6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Prior to the time of last stitch, the internal carotid was back-bled through this.  The last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The internal was again gently occluded while flow was restored to the common and external carotids for several moments and then flow was restored to the entire system.  At this point, a total of 50 mg of Protamine was administered and allowed to take effect.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and closed in layers using #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl.
